# CRITICAL E-2 REQUIREMENT
If visaType="E2", you MUST include evisaInvestment section.

# MANDATORY E-VISA SECTIONS - ALL MUST BE INCLUDED
**CRITICAL**: If ANY of these sections are missing, the extraction is INVALID and INCOMPLETE:
1. **evisaClassification** - ALWAYS REQUIRED
2. **evisaBusiness** - ALWAYS REQUIRED
3. **evisaApplicationContact** - ALWAYS REQUIRED (Extract from DS-156E Sections 26 & 27)
4. **evisaOwnership** - ALWAYS REQUIRED
5. **evisaFinanceTrade** - ALWAYS REQUIRED
6. **evisaEmployeeCounts** - ALWAYS REQUIRED
7. **evisaUSPersonnel** - ALWAYS REQUIRED
8. **evisaApplicantPosition** - ALWAYS REQUIRED (Extract from DS-156E Section 18)

10. **evisaInvestment** - REQUIRED for E-2 visas
11. **evisaForeignBusiness** - REQUIRED if businessType="S" (Subsidiary)
12. **evisaTrade** - REQUIRED for E-1 visas

**DO NOT OUTPUT JSON WITHOUT ALL MANDATORY SECTIONS**

## DS-156E Section 12 Quick Reference:
The DS-156E Section 12 has FIVE rows (Cash, Inventory, Equipment, Property, Other) with two columns each (Initial Investment, Total Cumulative Investment).

### IMPORTANT MAPPING RULES:
1. **Paid-in capital goes in "Other" row, NOT Cash row**
2. **Additional paid-in capital goes in otherInitial, NOT cashInitial**
3. **Each category must satisfy: Initial ≤ Total Cumulative**
4. **investmentType codes**: "E" = Continuation (subsidiaries), "C" = Creation (new), "P" = Purchase

### For Subsidiaries:
- Look for "paid-in capital" or "additional paid-in capital" in DS-156E
- This amount goes in **otherInitial** (NOT cashInitial)
- Cash row is for actual liquid cash transfers only
- Other row includes paid-in capital, goodwill, intangibles

  - Section 23: Position in the United States (EXTRACT FULL TEXT)
  - Section 12: Investment amounts table
  - Section 14: Employee counts table
  - Section 11: Fair market value
  - Sections 19-21: Employment and education details

</phase1_document_discovery>

## CRITICAL: DS-156E IS YOUR PRIMARY SOURCE
**MANDATORY RULE**: The DS-156E form is the AUTHORITATIVE source for E-visa applications.

### Always extract these from DS-156E (not from worksheets or other documents):
1. **Position Descriptions**: 
   - Section 18: "Present Position and Duties" - COPY THE FULL TEXT
   - Section 23: "Position in the United States" - COPY THE FULL TEXT
2. **Investment Data**: Section 12 table with exact amounts
3. **Employee Counts**: Section 14 table with exact numbers
4. **Employer Information**: Sections 19-20
5. **Education**: Section 21
6. **Salary/Benefits**: Section 24

**WARNING**: Using DS-160 worksheet data instead of DS-156E will result in incorrect/incomplete extraction!

<phase2_extraction>
## PHASE 2: E-VISA EXTRACTION STRATEGY

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Locate and read the DS-156E form**
- This is a multi-page PDF titled "NONIMMIGRANT TREATY TRADER/INVESTOR APPLICATION"
- Form number DS-156E should be visible on the document
- If you cannot find the DS-156E, alert that it is missing

**CRITICAL PDF READING INSTRUCTION:**
DS-156E forms typically have MIXED PAGE FORMATS:
- Pages 1-2: Text-based (machine readable)
- Page 3: Scanned image (requires OCR)

YOU MUST:
1. Read text layers for pages with embedded text
2. Use OCR for scanned image pages (especially page 3)
3. DO NOT assume all pages are text-based
4. If a page appears blank or empty, it's likely a scanned image - use OCR to read it
5. Sections 18-27 are typically on the scanned page 3 - ALWAYS use OCR for this page

**PASS 1: Business Structure (FROM DS-156E)**
- Company name and type from DS-156E Section 1 (REMOVE punctuation: no commas, periods)
- Incorporation details from DS-156E Section 4 (date, city, state)
- Business activities from DS-156E Sections 5-6
- Office locations from DS-156E Section 3
- Parent company from DS-156E Section 7

**PASS 2: Ownership Analysis (FROM DS-156E Section 8)**
- Extract ALL owners/shareholders from Section 8 table
- Use exact percentages from "PERCENT OF OWNERSHIP" column (MUST total 100%)
- Verify treaty country majority ownership (>50%)
- Document ownership structure

**PASS 3: Application Contact Information - FROM DS-156E SECTIONS 26 AND 27**
**CRITICAL**: This section is MANDATORY for all E-visa applications
- **DS-156E Section 26**: "Responsible Officer for Application"
  - Extract the name, title, and position of the responsible officer
  - This is typically a high-ranking company officer (VP, Director, etc.)
  - Example: Name, Title like "VP General Affairs"
- **DS-156E Section 27**: "Contact Person for Application"
  - Extract the attorney or representative's information
  - Look for law firm name, attorney name, address, phone, fax, email
  - Common pattern: Law firm contact (e.g., Attorney at Tomita Law Office PC)
  - Complete address including suite/floor numbers
  - Phone without formatting (e.g., 2025551234 not 202-555-1234)
  - Email address if provided
- **IMPORTANT**: Section 27 contact is usually the attorney/representative handling the case
- **IMPORTANT**: Section 26 officer is usually a company executive authorizing the application

**PASS 4: Financial Extraction (FROM DS-156E Section 9)**
- Assets (current and fixed) from Section 9
- Liabilities (current and long-term) from Section 9
- Owner's equity from Section 9
- Income/Revenue figures from Section 9
- Trade volumes from Section 10 (for E-1)
- Investment amounts from Section 12 (for E-2)

**PASS 5: Employee Analysis**
- Treaty nationals count
- US citizens/LPR count
- Third country nationals
- Management vs specialized vs other roles
- Key personnel details

**PASS 6: Applicant Position - MUST USE DS-156E SECTIONS 18 AND 23**
- **DS-156E PAGE 3, Section 18**: Find "Present Position and Duties (Describe in detail)" 
  - COPY THE ENTIRE TEXT from this section (usually 5-10 sentences)
  - DO NOT USE worksheet or other sources for this
- **DS-156E PAGE 3, Section 23**: Find "Position in the United States"
  - Under "Description of duties" COPY THE ENTIRE TEXT (usually includes bullet points)
  - This often starts with "This is the second highest executive..." or similar
  - Look for mention of "immediate subordinates" - Extract their names from DS-156E Section 15 personnel list
  - Check if replacing someone - Often mentioned in support letter or Section 23
- **DS-156E Section 15**: List of key personnel - Extract subordinate names if mentioned in duties
- **DS-156E Section 19**: Employer name and address
- **DS-156E Section 20**: Years with present employer  
- **DS-156E Section 21**: Education (school, degree, major, year)
- **DS-156E Section 24**: Annual salary and benefits
- **DS-156E Section 25** (if exists): May ask about replacing a person
- **Support Letter**: Check for mentions of:
  - Names of direct reports/subordinates
  - Whether applicant is replacing a previous visa holder
- **WRITING STYLE**: Remove ALL personal pronouns and names from position descriptions
  - NO: "Mr. Endo", "he", "his", "her", "their"
  - YES: Start with action verbs or "Responsible for"
  - Example: "Manages team" NOT "He manages team"
- CRITICAL: If text appears truncated in your view, request the full text
- NEVER USE DS-160 WORKSHEET for position descriptions - ONLY DS-156E!
</phase2_extraction>

<phase3_validation>
## PHASE 3: E-VISA SPECIFIC VALIDATION

### DS-156E Section 14 Employee Count Extraction
**CRITICAL**: Extract EXACT values from DS-156E PART II - STAFF, Section 14 table
- DO NOT calculate, derive, or adjust these numbers
- Read directly from the table cells as shown
- If a cell is blank or 0, use "0"
- These are the ONLY valid sources for employee counts
- DO NOT use total employee count from other sections
- DO NOT infer or estimate based on company size
- For DLI North America: Use Treaty (7/20/0), US (1/6/3), Third (0/0/0)

### Critical E-Visa Rules
1. **Ownership MUST total exactly 100%** - This is non-negotiable
2. **Treaty country nationals must own >50%** for E-visa qualification
3. **Financial statements must balance**: Assets - Liabilities = Owner Equity
4. **Employee counts must be logical**: Sum of categories = Total
5. **Investment must be "substantial"** relative to business type
6. **Trade must be "substantial"** and principally with treaty country (E-1)
7. **DS-156E Section 12 Values MUST be exact**:
   - Read Initial Investment column exactly (even $100.00)
   - Read Total Cumulative Investment column exactly
   - Initial and Total can be different (especially for "Other")
   - Blank fields = "0", "Included in X" = "0"

### Financial Validation
- Verify all financial figures are consistent
- Check that equity calculations are correct
- Ensure investment amounts match documentation
- Validate trade percentages if provided

### Business Logic Validation
- Business type must match activities
- Incorporation date < Current date
- Office addresses must be complete
- Phone numbers must be digits only (no formatting)
</phase3_validation>

## CRITICAL APPLICANT POSITION EXTRACTION

**MANDATORY**: You MUST extract BOTH sections with FULL DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS:

1. **evisaApplicantPosition**: Current/present employment position
   - **PRIMARY SOURCE**: DS-156E Section 18 "Present Position and Duties" - Extract the COMPLETE description
   - **SECONDARY SOURCES**: Support letter, employment letter, resume
   - For visa renewals: This may be their current US position (if already working in US)
   - **REQUIRED LENGTH**: Minimum 5-6 sentences (100-150 words)
   - Include ALL details: management scope, subordinates, responsibilities, decision-making authority
   - **WRITING STYLE**: Remove ALL personal pronouns (he/she/his/her/their) and names (Mr./Ms.)

2. **evisaApplicantUSPosition**: Position in the United States (continuation/future)
   - **PRIMARY SOURCE**: DS-156E Section 23 "Position in the United States" - Extract the COMPLETE description
   - **SECONDARY SOURCES**: Support letter describing continued/future duties
   - This describes duties after visa approval/renewal
   - **REQUIRED LENGTH**: Minimum 5-6 sentences (100-150 words)
   - Include ALL details: specific responsibilities, reporting structure, strategic objectives
   - **WRITING STYLE**: Use impersonal, role-focused language (no pronouns or names)

**CRITICAL DS-156E SECTIONS**:
- Section 18: Contains the detailed "Present Position and Duties" paragraph
- Section 23: Contains the detailed "Position in the United States" paragraph
- Section 15: Lists personnel - Use to identify subordinate names if duties mention managing people
- DO NOT SUMMARIZE - Extract the FULL text from these sections

**SUBORDINATE AND REPLACEMENT EXTRACTION**:
- If Section 23 mentions "immediate subordinates" or "direct reports", set hasImmediateSubordinates = true
- Extract subordinate names from DS-156E Section 15 personnel list (those reporting to this position)
- Check support letter for any mention of "replacing" or "succeeding" someone
- If replacing someone, extract their name and previous visa information

**STAFFING AND CONTINUATION QUESTIONS** (when NOT replacing someone):
- **willIncreaseStaff**: Check if position will lead to hiring additional U.S. staff
  - Look for mentions in support letter about expansion plans or hiring
  - For executive roles, this is often false unless specific expansion mentioned
- **continuationOfEmployment**: Is this a continuation of current U.S. employment?
  - For VISA RENEWALS: Usually TRUE (continuing same position)
  - For INITIAL E-VISA: Usually FALSE (new position in U.S.)
  - Check DS-156E Section 25 if it asks about continuation

**WARNING**: Short 1-sentence descriptions will cause visa processing delays!

## DS-156E Section 12 Investment Mapping Rules

### CRITICAL: Map DS-156E Section 12 Table Exactly
The DS-156E Section 12 contains an investment table with these categories:
- **Cash**: Actual cash investments (bank transfers, liquid funds)
- **Inventory**: Stock, materials, supplies for business operations
- **Equipment**: Machinery, computers, vehicles, tools
- **Property**: Real estate, buildings, land
- **Other**: Paid-in capital, intangible assets, goodwill, patents, licenses

### DS-156E Section 11 - Fair Market Value:
- **fairMarketValue** = DS-156E Section 11 "Fair Market Value of Business" 
- Only required when investmentType = "E" (Continuation)
- This is the total business valuation, typically equals Owner's Equity

### Extraction Rules for Each Category:
1. **Cash Row**:
   - cashInitial = DS-156E Section 12 "Cash" Initial Investment column
   - cashTotal = DS-156E Section 12 "Cash" Total Cumulative Investment column
   - This is ONLY actual cash, NOT paid-in capital

2. **Inventory Row**:
   - inventoryInitial = DS-156E Section 12 "Inventory" Initial Investment column
   - inventoryTotal = DS-156E Section 12 "Inventory" Total Cumulative Investment column

3. **Equipment Row**:
   - equipmentInitial = DS-156E Section 12 "Equipment" Initial Investment column
   - equipmentTotal = DS-156E Section 12 "Equipment" Total Cumulative Investment column

4. **Property Row**:
   - propertyInitial = DS-156E Section 12 "Property" Initial Investment column
   - propertyTotal = DS-156E Section 12 "Property" Total Cumulative Investment column

5. **Other Row** (MOST IMPORTANT FOR SUBSIDIARIES):
   - otherInitial = DS-156E Section 12 "Other" Initial Investment column
   - otherTotal = DS-156E Section 12 "Other" Total Cumulative Investment column
   - **Paid-in capital from parent company goes HERE, not in cash**
   - **Additional paid-in capital goes HERE**
   - Intangible assets, goodwill, patents also go here

### Logical Validation Rules:
- Initial Investment ≤ Total Cumulative Investment for EACH category
- If a field is blank/empty in DS-156E, use "0"
- For established subsidiaries, "Other" often contains the largest initial investment (paid-in capital)
- Cash initial is typically small (operating cash at founding) unless there were actual cash transfers
- **IMPORTANT**: Read EXACT values from DS-156E - even small amounts like $100.00 are valid
- **CRITICAL**: Initial and Total values can be different - read both columns carefully
- Small cash amounts (e.g., $100) are common for initial operating funds
- The "Other" Total may exceed "Other" Initial due to retained earnings or additional capital

## CRITICAL E-VISA FIELD NAMING RULES
1. **USE EXACT FIELD NAMES** - Do not improvise or create new field names
2. **Business fields**:
   - Use "incorporationDate" NOT "establishedDate"
   - Use "incorporationCity" and "incorporationState" separately, NOT "establishedPlace"
   - Use "businessType" for the CODE ONLY (C, P, B, R, J, S, or O)
3. **When businessType is "S" (Subsidiary)**, MUST include evisaForeignBusiness section with:
   - hasForeignBusiness = true
   - Complete parentBusiness details
   - foreignEntities array with parent company information
4. **Do NOT add fields not in the structure** (no "parentCompany" at root level)
5. **Company names**: Remove ALL punctuation
   - "DLI North America, Inc." → "DLI North America Inc"
   - "The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Ltd." → "The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company Ltd"
6. **Phone numbers**: Digits only, no formatting
   - Remove: +, -, (), spaces, periods
   - "212-350-7600" → "2123507600"
7. **Dates**: Always DD-MMM-YYYY format
8. **States**: Use 2-letter codes (NY, CA, DE)
9. **Countries**: Use 3-letter codes (USA, JPN, CHN)
10. **Numeric values**: As strings ("100" not 100)
11. **Omit empty fields entirely** - don't include the key

## MANDATORY E-VISA VALIDATION

### Critical Checks
1. **Ownership totals EXACTLY 100%** - Sum all percentageOwnership values
2. **Treaty country owns >50%** - Sum ownership from treaty country nationals
3. **Financial balance**: totalAssets - totalLiabilities = ownerEquity
4. **Employee counts logical**: Sum of categories equals stated total
5. **All company names sanitized**: No commas, periods, or special punctuation
6. **Subsidiary validation**: If businessType="S", evisaForeignBusiness MUST be present with parent details
7. **E-2 validation**: If visaType="E2", evisaInvestment MUST be present with investment amounts
8. **Position validation**: MUST include BOTH evisaApplicantPosition (current job) AND evisaApplicantUSPosition (future US job)

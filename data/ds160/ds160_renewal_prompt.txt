## DS-160 RENEWAL INSTRUCTIONS

This is a visa RENEWAL. I have provided:
1. **Original DS-160** - The previous application data
2. **Renewal Worksheet** - Contains ONLY the updated/changed information

**YOUR TASK:**
- First, identify which document is the original DS-160 and which is the renewal worksheet
- Use the original DS-160 as your base data
- REPLACE any fields that appear in the renewal worksheet with the NEW values (don't merge, completely replace)
- Keep all other fields from the original DS-160 unchanged
- Most common updates: new passport number, new address, new employer, new travel dates

**CRITICAL:** When you see updated information in the renewal worksheet, REPLACE the old information entirely. For example, if there's a new passport number, replace ALL passport fields (number, issue date, expiry date) with the new information.

After identifying the updates, generate the complete DS-160 JSON following the standard DS-160 format.

Consular Section, E Visa Unit

Re:	E-2 Treaty Investor Corporate Registration and Visa Application
U.S. Employer: 	Craif USA Inc. ("Craif USA")
Applicant: 	Mr. Ryuichi Onose

Dear Honorable Consul:

This letter is written in support of the enclosed E-2 Treaty Investor Corporate Registration Application for Craif USA Inc. ("Craif USA") and the E-2 Treaty Investor Visa Application filed by Mr. Ryuichi Onose, who is the Co-Founder and CEO of Craif Inc. ("Craif Japan"), the 100% parent company of Craif USA.

Subject to your approval, Mr. Onose will assume the executive position of President at Craif USA to manage and direct the entire operations of the newly launched U.S. business as the highest executive with broad discretionary authority to determine the overall local operations and direction of Craif USA. He will concurrently hold the executive position at Craif Japan to continue controlling the company's global business direction as the Co-Founder and CEO.

The rest of this letter, along with the enclosed supporting evidence, will explain and demonstrate Craif USA's eligibility for E-2 Treaty Investor company status, and Mr. Onose's eligibility for E-2 employee status.

E-2 Visa Eligibility

The present application filed on behalf of Craif USA and Mr. Onose meet all the requirements specified under 9 FAM 402.9 as follows:

The requisite treaty exists (9 FAM 402.9-4(A))

The U.S.-Japan Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation between the U.S. and Japan is an E-2 qualifying treaty.

Mr. Onose, as well as Craif USA possess the nationality of the treaty country, Japan (9 FAM 402.9-4(B))

Mr. Onose is a citizen of Japan. Craif USA is wholly owned by Craif Japan, majority of whose shares are co-owned by 4 Japanese citizens (40.13%) and 4 Japanese public companies (10.48%). According to 8 CFR 214.2(e)(7), "[i]n the case of an enterprise or organization, ownership must be traced as best as it is practicable to the individuals who are ultimately its owners." For a publicly traded company, the company's nationality is presumed to be that of the country in which the company's stocks are exclusively exchanged. 9 FAM 402.9-4(B). Since Craif USA is wholly owned by Craif Japan, which is at least 50.62% owned by Japanese nationals, Craif USA's nationality is Japanese.

Applicant has made qualifying investments (9 FAM 402.9-6(B))

Craif USA has made substantial E-2 qualifying investments in the U.S., with a capital infusion of $200,000 and a loan of $1,182,756.97 ($500,000 and Â¥100 million JPY) from Craif Japan. To date, Craif USA has expended at least $678,631.90 as shown in the accompanying evidence (Tab 3-2). These committed funds have already been deployed toward preliminary research and development, office lease commitments, and the acquisition of specimen samples essential for adapting Craif Japan's proprietary cancer screening technology for the U.S. market. Craif USA has also made significant investments in consulting with U.S.-based biotechnology research specialists and experts in the medical and pharmaceutical sectors. These consultants have played a critical role in helping the company interpret test results and data, and in building the operational framework necessary to launch U.S. activitiesâwhile ensuring that the introduction of this life-saving diagnostic technology is both practical and fully compliant with applicable regulatory, clinical, and industry standards.

The U.S. enterprise, Craif USA, is a real and operating/active commercial enterprise (9 FAM 402.9-6(c))

Incorporated in October 2022, Craif USA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Craif Japan, a pioneer in early and precision cancer detection technology. With the goal of introducing the parent company's proprietary cancer screening service and testing kit to the U.S. market, Craif USA has taken active steps to establish operations, including the employment of one local worker (who departed in November 2024, with recruitment efforts for a replacement currently underway, as documented in Tab 5). The company continues to prepare for the official launch of its U.S. business, which is contingent upon the approval of Mr. Onose's visa. In 2024, Craif USA established its laboratory operations by partnering with a contract research organization ("CRO") in Irvine, California. Retained and managed by Craif USA, the CRO stores and processes specimen samples purchased by Craif USA and provides analytical data to Craif Japan. Upon issuance of Mr. Onose's visa, Craif USA will initiate its own research activities aimed at enhancing the quality and responsiveness of the services it provides to its parent company. The company also plans to officially launch its early cancer screening service and proprietary testing kit in the U.S. As detailed above, Craif USA has already made substantial investments in research and development to facilitate the successful introduction of these testing kits and has committed significant operating capital to ensure a smooth launch and the long-term growth of its U.S. operations. These efforts are strongly supported by the parent company, which has demonstrated a significant and ongoing commitment to Craif USA's success, both financially and strategically.

According to 9 FAM 402.9-6(C), "[i]f the investment relates to a new enterprise, then you must be convinced that it will be a real and active commercial entrepreneurial undertaking that will produce some service or commodity if the visa is issued." This case clearly pertains to a new enterprise, as Craif USA's full-scale operationsâincluding establishing its own research function, sales and marketing of diagnostic kits, building partnerships in the biotechnology and insurance sectors, developing localized products, pursuing FDA approval to enhance the product's appeal, and moreâwill be fully activated upon the approval of Mr. Onose's visa. Until now, Craif USA's activities have been limited in scope, functioning solely as a coordinating office with one local employee without independent commercial operations. The absence of the founder or a representative from the Japanese parent company on the ground has restricted the company's ability to initiate and manage active business functions locally. The transfer of Mr. Onose, who possesses the necessary expertise and authority to lead U.S. operations, will mark a clear and definitive start of substantive business activities in the U.S.

Through its E-2 qualifying, irrevocable investments, Craif USA has demonstrated both the readiness and commitment required to operate as a real and active commercial enterprise. These investments, coupled with the strategic appointment of Mr. Onose, establish a clear pathway for the company to deliver the innovative diagnostic services described above once the visa is issued.

Craif Japan's investments in the U.S. enterprise through its subsidiary, Craif USA, are substantial (9 FAM 402.9-6(D))

As mentioned above, Craif Japan has made substantial E-2 qualifying investments in the U.S. totaling $1,382,756.97 (please see #3 for details). Of this capital allocation, at least $678,631.90 has been committed as E-2 qualifying irrevocable investments. Craif Japan's investment is substantial in a proportional senseâit has invested 100% of the actual cost needed to the point of Craif USA being operationalâand is demonstrative of Craif Japan's financial commitment to the successful operations and development of its U.S. subsidiary.

Investment is more than a marginal one solely for earning a living (9 FAM 402.9-6(E))

As explained in the enclosed 5-Year Business Plan (Tab 5-1), Craif USA has well-defined business strategies and concrete plans to ensure steady growth over the next five years. The company is projected to generate sufficient income to support more than a minimal living for the treaty investor and their family. Further, as evidenced by its substantial financial commitment, Craif Japan is fully dedicated to the growth and long-term success of Craif USA.

Craif USA has already hired one U.S. worker (who has since left the company) and is actively seeking both a replacement and additional personnel. As the business continues to grow, Craif USA plans to expand its local workforce over the next five years to support its operational and strategic goals.

Applicant is in a position to "develop and direct" the enterprise (9 FAM 402.9-6(F))

Craif Japan, a Japanese company, owns 100% of Craif USA, and as such, with full controlling interest, it develops and directs the activities of Craif USA.

Mr. Onose, an employee, is destined to a supervisory (executive) position in the U.S. (9 FAM 402.9-7)

Mr. Onose, a Japanese citizen, will assume the executive position of President to preside over all aspects of operations at Craif USA as the highest executive. Please see the "Offered Position: President" section below for further detail about this position.

Mr. Onose intends to depart the U.S. upon the termination of his temporary stay pursuant to E-2 status (9 FAM 402.9-4(C))

Mr. Onose intends to depart the U.S. upon the completion of his temporary assignment pursuant to E-2 status to resume his employment with Craif Japan in Japan.

The rest of this letter will demonstrate the nature of Mr. Onose's temporary assignment and his eligibility for E-2 classification.

Japanese Parent Company: Craif Inc. ("Craif Japan")

In May 2018, Craif Japan was founded by Mr. Ryuichi Onose and Dr. Takao Yasui in collaboration with Nagoya University in Aichi, Japan. With the mission to realize a world of peaceful longevity, the company researches, develops, and provides early cancer detection technology based on its proprietary NANO IP (NANO Intelligence Platform). This innovation is derived from Dr. Yasui's nanodevice research and collaborations with over 20 universities and research institutions, including the National Cancer Center of Japan.

Craif Japan's proprietary testing kit, miSignal, provides detailed cancer screening results using only urine samples collected either at local medical facilities or from the comfort of home, making cancer screening more accessible and convenient. To expand access to its services, Craif Japan actively partners with pharmacies, medical facilities, and corporations, helping them incorporate its innovative screening solutions into regular health checks for patients and employees. miSignal is currently adopted by over 1,000 medical facilities in Japan. In addition to its screening services, the company also provides R&D services for corporate clients, utilizing its NANO IP to effectively analyze exosomesâa type of extracellular vesicle involved in intercellular communication.

Craif Japan employs 75 staff members and operates a head office in Tokyo and a laboratory located within Nagoya University. The company has received numerous corporate awards for its social contributions and business success, including the Finalist of WIPO Global Awards 2024 and Unreasonable Impact Asia Pacific 2024. Recently, in its Series C funding round, Craif Japan raised 1 billion JPY at the first close in December 2024 and 2 billion JPY at the second close in April 2025, bringing its total funding to 8.2 billion JPY (approximately $57 million).

U.S. Employer: Craif USA Inc. ("Craif USA")

Incorporated in October 2022, Craif USA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Craif Japan, established to accelerate Craif Japan's global business expansion. Following recent funding, Craif Japan decided to officially launch U.S. business operations by capitalizing the subsidiary with $200,000 in March 2025 and allocating $682,756.97 (Â¥100 million JPY) as a loan in April 2025 to introduce its life-saving cancer screening kits to the U.S. market.

Craif USA is positioned to operate as a research-driven biotechnology company specializing in early cancer detection. Its core business activities include collecting and processing specimen samples within the U.S. to generate population-specific data that not only supports the development and localization of Craif USA's own cancer screening services, but also contributes to the ongoing refinement of Craif Japan's proprietary diagnostic platforms and future products. In addition to conducting its own research, Craif USA will provide continuous analytical support, reporting, and consulting to Craif Japanâoffering insights into U.S.-based population data and assisting in regulatory strategy, including preparation for FDA submissions and compliance planning.

In parallel, Craif USA is building a robust network within the U.S. medical, biotechnology, and insurance industries to support the integration of its cancer screening services into the broader healthcare ecosystem. As part of its business operations, Craif USA will localize the parent company's early cancer screening service and testing kit for the U.S. market. This includes developing and finalizing clinical protocols, conducting clinical trials, securing FDA approval, and preparing a scalable sales and distribution structure. The company will also work directly with insurance providers to facilitate inclusion of the screening service in coverage plans and to negotiate reimbursement rates. These steps are essential to ensuring regulatory compliance, commercial viability, and widespread accessibility of the product in the U.S.

To support commercialization, Craif USA will engage in brand-building, marketing, and partnership development effortsâparticularly with medical institutions and clinicsâto accelerate user adoption and market penetration. Meanwhile, it will continue investing in research and development to improve the diagnostic platform and expand its application to other types of cancers.

Craif USA has already begun implementing this business plan by partnering with industry-expert consultants, a specimen collection company, and ResearchDx, Inc.âa California-based contract research organization (CRO). It has secured office space within ResearchDx's headquarters in Irvine, California, from which it conducts research activities. Although Craif USA's first U.S. employee departed in November 2024, the company is actively recruiting research professionals through a U.S.-based talent acquisition agency to establish and expand its in-house research function.

Offered Position: President

Subject to your approval, Mr. Onose will assume the executive position of President at Craif USA. This is the highest executive position of the U.S. company, having discretionary authority to preside over Craif USA's overall management, business operations, and administration. In this position, Mr. Onose will direct and manage the business expansion including talent acquisition and will serve as a public face of the company to promote its market presence in the U.S. Particularly, Mr. Onose will be responsible for the following:

Manage the budget and make all final decisions regarding capital allocations in the U.S. based on review of existing and prospective investments and projects and determination regarding the profitability and viability of said projects in the U.S.;

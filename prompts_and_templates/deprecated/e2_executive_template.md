He will be primarily engaged in high-level executive functions, and not involved in the routine performance of operational tasks, which are assigned to his subordinate managers and professional staff.

Beneficiary: Mr. Takuro Iwashita

Mr. Iwashita is highly qualified to assume the position of Executive Director, Powertrain at ITCA, based on his academic background and over two decades of progressive experience with Isuzu in the development, testing, and optimization of diesel engine systems. He earned his Bachelor of Engineering and Master of Engineering degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Waseda University in March 1999 and March 2001, respectively.

In April 2001, Mr. Iwashita joined Isuzu and participated in intensive new hire training focused on Isuzu's proprietary engine and powertrain development, testing, and engineering systems and procedures. Following the completion of this training, Mr. Iwashita began his formal engineering career in December 2001 as an Engineer in the Engine Experiment Department No. 1. Between December 2001 and March 2005, he engaged in performance testing and DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) regeneration compliance for diesel engines, planned and executed test procedures, analyzed test data, and reported results during project meetings. Notably, he led the development of the DPF system for the 6HL1 engine installed in the 2004MY "Forward" medium-duty trucks for the Japanese market—one of the earliest mass-production DPF projects globally, which required creating new development methodologies from the ground up.

From April 2005 to June 2007, Mr. Iwashita continued in the same department and was responsible for the DPF development of the DURAMAX 7800 engine installed in the 2007MY "GMC Topkick" truck for the U.S. market. He implemented performance testing procedures that addressed the environmental and regulatory conditions unique to the U.S., including high-altitude and low-temperature operation, ultimately achieving successful overseas deployment of the DPF.

Between July 2007 and March 2010, Mr. Iwashita was promoted to Supervisor in the same department and began supervising junior engineers. He led the development of the SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) system for the 6HK1 engine installed in 2010MY "Forward" trucks in Japan—another first for Isuzu's mass-production efforts in NOx reduction technology.

From April 2010 to July 2015, Mr. Iwashita remained as a Supervisor in the same department, expanding his leadership responsibilities to manage a team of four engineers. He supervised performance and emission conformity testing, variable adjustments, and quality gate meetings. As project leader, he directed the adaptation of the 6NX1 engine—originally developed for medium-duty trucks—for installation in large-duty "Giga" trucks. His team implemented Japan's first sequential twin turbo system for large trucks to meet downsizing requirements, achieving full production in 2015.

Between July 2015 and January 2020, Mr. Iwashita was assigned to the U.S. at ITCA as Specialist, Powertrain Vehicle R&D and later as Supervisor, Powertrain Engineering. He provided training and guidance to local engineers to support autonomous development capabilities at ITCA. Notably, he led the development and emission conformity testing of the 4HK1 engine installed in the U.S.-spec F-series medium-duty trucks, successfully completing Isuzu's first fully independent overseas development project, which launched in 2017 (17MY) and 2019 (19MY).

From January 2020 to June 2024, Mr. Iwashita returned to Isuzu in Japan and served as Manager of the Engine Experiment Department No.1, where he supervised a team of eight subordinates. He led the performance and emission development of the next-generation 4HK1 engine for 2025MY "Forward" trucks, overseeing all test planning, result analysis, and hardware selection. His responsibilities also included managing diesel engine calibration for emissions and performance conformity, creating calibration variables for engine optimization, and drafting experimental planning documents and technical reports. He regularly reported project progress and technical content at project meetings, participated in policy decisions regarding development direction, and provided guidance and training to junior engineers. In addition, he presented key findings and status updates at internal quality gate meetings to ensure engineering alignment across departments.

Since July 2024, Mr. Iwashita has remained in the same managerial role and currently leads the development of the 4HK1 engine for the 2027MY "N-Series" trucks in the U.S., which are being developed to comply with the world's most stringent exhaust emission regulations. He continues to perform diesel engine calibration and conformity assessment, supervise calibration parameter development, and lead technical reporting and decision-making at project meetings. Due to his successful leadership in managing global engine development programs, he was selected mid-project to oversee this critical effort.

Accompanying Individual

Mr. Iwashita will not be accompanied by any family members at this time.

Terms of Employment

Subject to your approval, Mr. Iwashita will replace Mr. Kamijo and assume the executive position of Executive Director, Powertrain at ITCA for a temporary period of 5 years. For his temporary services in the U.S., he will be compensated in the amount of $184,590, including standard company benefits. Upon the completion of his temporary assignment in the U.S., Mr. Iwashita will return to Japan to resume his employment with Isuzu.

Based on the foregoing, we respectfully request your favorable adjudication of this matter.

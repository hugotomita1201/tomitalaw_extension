Re:    	E-2 Treaty Investor Corporate Registration and Visa Application
	U.S. Employer: EIKEN MEDICAL AMERICA INC.
	Applicant: Mr. Hisato Idekoba
	Position: Chief Executive Officer

Dear Honorable Consul:

This letter is written in support of the enclosed E-2 Treaty Investor Corporate Registration Application for EIKEN MEDICAL AMERICA INC. ("Eiken America"), a wholly owned subsidiary of EIKEN CHEMICAL CO., LTD. ("Eiken Chemical") in Japan, as well as the E-2 Visa Application filed on behalf of Mr. Hisato Idekoba, who currently serves as General Manager in the Global Business Department I at Eiken Chemical. Subject to your approval, Mr. Idekoba will assume the executive position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at Eiken America to manage and direct the company's day-to-day operations as the highest-ranking local executive. He will hold broad discretionary authority to guide and determine the overall operations of the U.S. subsidiary.

The rest of this letter, along with the enclosed supporting evidence, will explain and demonstrate Eiken America's eligibility for E-2 Treaty Investor company status, and Mr. Idekoba's eligibility for E-2 visa.

E-2 Visa Eligibility

The present application filed on behalf of Eiken America and Mr. Idekoba meets all the requirements specified under 9 FAM 402.9 as follows:

The requisite treaty exists (9 FAM 402.9-4(A))

The U.S.-Japan Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation between the U.S. and Japan is an E-2 qualifying treaty.

Mr. Idekoba, as well as Eiken America possess the nationality of the treaty country, Japan (9 FAM 402.9-4(B))

Mr. Idekoba is a citizen of Japan, and Eiken America is 100% owned by Eiken Chemical, a Japanese corporation whose shares trade publicly on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Japan.

According to 8 CFR 214.2(e)(7), "[i]n the case of an enterprise or organization, ownership must be traced as best as it is practicable to the individuals who are ultimately its owners." For a publicly traded company, the company's nationality is presumed to be that of the country in which the company's stocks are exclusively exchanged. 9 FAM 402.9-4(B). As Eiken Chemical's shares are exclusively traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Japan, Eiken America's nationality is presumed to be Japanese.

Applicant has made qualifying investments (9 FAM 402.9-6(B))

In order to establish its U.S.-based subsidiary Eiken America, Eiken Chemical has thus far invested $500,000 in capital in Eiken America. Out of the capital investment from the parent company, Eiken America has made at least $244,291.29 worth of E-2 qualifying irrevocable investments in the U.S. including: office furniture, prepaid rent for the office, and various startup costs as listed in the enclosed list of investments (Tab 3-2(1)).

The U.S. enterprise, Eiken America, meets the real and operating/active commercial enterprise requirement (9 FAM 402.9-6(C))

Incorporated in November 2023, Eiken America seeks to launch its formal operations upon the approval of Mr. Idekoba's E-2 visa. As a wholly owned subsidiary of Eiken Chemical, a leading manufacturer and supplier of clinical diagnostic products and equipment, the company will support the expansion of its parent's U.S. business, generating revenue through service fees. Eiken America's responsibilities include assisting with FDA applications, supporting Eiken Chemical's participation in academic conferences and exhibitions (e.g., substitute participation, presentation support, and accompaniment), and conducting research on new products and potential mergers and acquisitions (M&A) opportunities. The company will also evaluate commercial distribution channels, provide proposals for joint and/or commissioned research, and perform market research to deliver actionable insights. Additionally, Eiken America will build relationships with key opinion leaders (KOLs), manage U.S. distributors, support contract negotiations, and conduct distributor research, including in specialized areas such as Serum Amyloid A (SAA). It will also handle market development, distributor research, contract negotiations, and distributor management in South America. Finally, Eiken America will oversee the storage, handling, and shipment of Eiken Chemical's equipment and spare parts to designated locations.

According to 9 FAM 402.9-6(C), "[i]f the investment relates to a new enterprise, then you must be convinced that it will be a real and active commercial entrepreneurial undertaking that will produce some service or commodity if the visa is issued." This case relates to a new enterprise, and as outlined above and supported by the E-2 qualifying irrevocable investments in the U.S., Eiken America will be a real and active commercial entrepreneurial undertaking, providing the aforementioned services upon the issuance of Mr. Idekoba's visa.

Eiken Chemical's investments in the U.S. enterprise through its subsidiary, Eiken America, are substantial (9 FAM 402.9-6(D))

As mentioned above, Eiken Chemical has thus far invested $500,000 in capital in Eiken America. Out of the capital investment, Eiken America has made at least $244,291.29 worth of E-2 qualifying irrevocable investments in the U.S. These investments clearly demonstrate Eiken Chemical and Eiken America's unquestionable commitment to the successful operations and development of Eiken America's business in the U.S.

Investment is more than a marginal one solely for earning a living (9 FAM 402.9-6(E))

Eiken Chemical's substantial financial commitment to its U.S. subsidiary, Eiken America, coupled with Eiken America's E-2 qualifying irrevocable investments, demonstrates that the company has well-defined business strategies and plans to ensure its steady growth with the future capacity to generate enough income to provide more than a minimal living for the treaty investor and his or her family. Eiken America has entered into a contract with a recruitment agency and projects generating $1.4 million in revenue, with the workforce expanding to 8 employees over the next five years.

Applicant is in a position to "develop and direct" the enterprise (9 FAM 402.9-6(F))

Eiken Chemical holds a 100% ownership stake in Eiken America, granting it complete control and authority to shape and guide the activities of Eiken America.

Mr. Idekoba, an employee, is destined to an executive position in the U.S. (9 FAM 402.9-7)

Mr. Idekoba, a Japanese citizen, will assume the executive position of CEO of Eiken America to preside over the day-to-day operations of Eiken America. Please refer to the "Offered Position: CEO" section below for further details about Mr. Idekoba's executive role at Eiken America.

Mr. Idekoba intends to depart the U.S. upon the termination of his temporary stay pursuant to E-2 status (9 FAM 402.9-4(C))

Upon the completion of his temporary assignment with Eiken America pursuant to E-2 visa status, Mr. Idekoba intends to return to Japan where he will continue his employment with Eiken Chemical.

The rest of this letter will demonstrate the nature of Mr. Idekoba's temporary assignment and his eligibility for E-2 classification.

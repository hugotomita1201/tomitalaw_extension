As a way of background, Nissin Foods Holdings has recently initiated the establishment of the RHQ–Americas Group within Nissin Foods USA, designating it as the functional regional headquarters for the Americas. This newly created organizational unit will be tasked with overseeing the strategic integration and consolidation of the group's operations across North America and Latin America. The RHQ–Americas Group will assume a pivotal role in harmonizing regional business strategies, aligning performance and governance structures, managing cross-border initiatives, and fostering synergy across subsidiaries as part of a unified regional growth platform. The appointment of Mr. Sarai as Director within this group is central to building out and executing the foundational structure and objectives of this regional headquarters function.

Offered Position: Director, RHQ-Americas Group

Subject to your approval, Mr. Sarai will assume the essential role of Director, RHQ–Americas Group at Nissin Foods USA. In this capacity, he will be responsible for formulating and executing mid- to long-term strategies for the North American subsidiaries of Nissin Foods Holdings, with a particular focus on optimizing operations and enhancing performance at Nissin Foods De Mexico S.A. de C.V. (hereinafter "Nissin Foods Mexico") as part of a broader regional integration initiative. Leveraging his expertise in market analysis—including local trends, consumer insights, and international sales strategy—Mr. Sarai will work to enhance the competitiveness and adaptability of the group's subsidiaries across the Americas. He will lead cross-border initiatives aimed at strengthening regional governance, consolidating operational frameworks, and driving sustainable growth. His specialized skills are vital to implementing these changes efficiently and in alignment with the global directives of Nissin Foods Holdings. Mr. Sarai's daily responsibilities will include:

Strategic Oversight and Business Management: Lead the formulation and execution of mid- to long-term business and branding strategies in alignment with Nissin Foods Holdings' global and regional growth objectives. Establish operational guidelines and performance indicators (KPIs) for the Mexican subsidiaries, monitor progress against strategic goals, and drive the development of actionable solutions to address emerging business challenges.

Regional Synergies and Operational Efficiency: Spearhead strategic initiatives aimed at generating group-wide synergies and enhancing operational efficiency through high-impact, project-driven activities. Identify and advance new product development opportunities—including non-instant noodle categories and the importation of Japan-origin products—to expand regional offerings and drive growth. Oversee the management of global key accounts such as Walmart and Costco, ensuring alignment with regional strategies and service excellence. Strengthen cross-border collaboration, particularly in supply chain operations, to optimize resource utilization, streamline logistics, and reinforce integrated performance across the Americas.

Mr. Sarai qualifies for E-2 classification as an essential skills employee under 9 FAM 402.9-7(C) because he possesses specialized qualifications that are indispensable to the successful establishment and operation of the RHQ–Americas Group within Nissin Foods USA. His assignment involves highly complex, cross-border functions—including the integration of regional business strategies, the alignment of governance systems across subsidiaries, and the execution of group-wide operational reforms—that require a rare combination of expertise in international market dynamics, brand localization, and corporate consolidation. These are not general skills, but rather highly specific competencies developed through extensive overseas assignments, deep familiarity with the Nissin Foods Group's corporate philosophy, and a proven track record of leading regional transformation efforts across Asia and Latin America. Such skills cannot be easily transferred to or replicated by available U.S. workers without significant cost, time, or operational disruption. Mr. Sarai's exceptional qualifications are further outlined in the following section.

Applicant: Mr. Kosei Sarai

Mr. Sarai is highly qualified to serve as Director of the RHQ-Americas Group at Nissin Foods USA, leveraging his extensive expertise in cross-border sales and business development, branding and marketing, corporate strategy and planning, product research, operational management, and the execution of growth strategies across the Americas and Asia.

Mr. Sarai earned a Bachelor of Arts in Language and Area Studies from Tokyo University of Foreign Studies in March 1999. Later, he earned a Master of Business Administration degree from Institute of Business and Accounting of Kwansei Gakuin University in March 2020. Immediately after completing his undergraduate study, Mr. Sarai joined Panasonic Corporation in April 1999.

After a 6-month of new employee training and language training in Japan, Mr. Sarai went through overseas training in Mexico from October 1999 to September 2001. During this training, he was responsible for the sales and marketing of multifunction copiers in international markets. He gained hands-on experience in frontline overseas sales operations and successfully achieved the company's first milestone of selling over 100 units in a single month. Additionally, he acquired business-level proficiency in Spanish.

From October 2001 to July 2003, Mr. Sarai was assigned to the Communication Device Sales Division within the Industry Sales Headquarters of Panasonic Energy Co. Ltd. in Tokyo, Japan, where he was responsible for corporate sales of AC adapters and batteries to major domestic mobile phone manufacturers, including NEC, Kyocera, Toshiba, and Panasonic. He achieved annual sales of 2.1 billion yen in FY2002, representing 71% of the planned target. Through competitive proposals that excelled in QCDS—Quality, Cost, Delivery, and Service—he secured new business opportunities, including supplying batteries to Kyocera.

From August 2003 to March 2011, Mr. Sarai served as Chief in the Overseas Marketing Department within the AVC Networks Company of Panasonic Corporation in Osaka, Japan. In this capacity, he handled overseas sales and marketing of digital cameras and camcorders across Latin America as well as the European and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) markets. He led the Latin American market to achieve annual sales of 1.05 million digital cameras in FY2010, quadrupling sales over a four-year period (2007–2010). He spearheaded initiatives to drive year-on-year growth by coordinating with eight Latin American sales companies, executing market-specific strategies such as expanding re-exports via Panama and establishing local production in Brazil. His responsibilities also included dealer negotiations, conducting in-store sales staff training, and managing PR activities to strengthen market presence and accelerate sales growth.

From April 2011 to March 2013, Mr. Sarai was temporarily assigned to the Product Marketing Department of Panasonic do Brasil Limitada in Brazil as Deputy General Manager. He led the planning and execution of marketing strategies for AV consumer electronics products—including audio systems and digital cameras—in the Brazilian market, managing a team of 3. His responsibilities included PSI (purchasing, sales, and inventory) as well as profit and loss (P&L) and pricing management. By conducting market analysis and user research in close collaboration with the Product Planning Division, he spearheaded the development of region-specific products tailored to local needs. This included creating large, high-output mini-component audio systems that catered to Latin America's unique audio culture and driving their expansion into major retail chains. He also enhanced brand recognition for digital cameras through promotional campaigns, notably featuring Neymar, a star player on the Brazilian national soccer team. In FY2012, he achieved annual sales of 8.2 billion yen, a 1.3-fold increase over two years.

From April 2013 to June 2017, Mr. Sarai was assigned to the Argentine Branch of Panasonic do Brasil Limitada as Senior Manager of the Business Development Department. As the second highest position supporting the local branch manager, he oversaw business planning, P&L and balance sheet management, and driving sustainable growth in a challenging environment of import restrictions and economic instability. He returned the branch to three consecutive years of profitability after prior losses by implementing a mid-term strategy that included withdrawing from unprofitable segments (TVs and digital cameras), focusing on major appliance, audio, and telephones, initiating local contract manufacturing, and introducing new product lines through government quota negotiations. He also strengthened export operations to secure import approvals, achieving FY2016 sales of 6.7 billion yen with positive profit.

From July 2017 to November 2020, Mr. Sarai returned to Panasonic Corporation's Appliances Company in Osaka, Japan. He served as Manager of the Americas Group and Merchandising Group in the TV Marketing Department within the Overseas Marketing Division. In this capacity, he led overseas sales and marketing for televisions in the Americas region, managing a team of three. He developed and executed business plans and marketing strategies, driving the expansion of Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) product offerings in collaboration with Chinese manufacturers to introduce market-optimized models across the region. Despite intensified competition and pandemic-driven demand decline, he coordinated closely with regional sales companies and business units to manage P&L effectively, achieving FY2020 sales of 8.2 billion yen and a profit of 290 million yen.

From December 2020 to March 2025, Mr. Sarai served as the Director of the Consumer Division for Panasonic Solutions (Thailand) Co., Ltd. During this period, he oversaw the sales, marketing, planning, and customer service functions for the home appliance business, managing 88 direct staff and approximately 500 personnel including contractors. Serving as a member of the executive team, he drove the integration of four local subsidiaries into a single entity while formulating and executing mid-term growth strategies and annual business plans. He managed PSI, P&L, and pricing, and led an organizational reform of the customer service division to enhance customer experience value. He successfully completed the phased consolidation of the subsidiaries—merging three in April 2022 and the fourth in April 2023—while achieving FY2024 sales of 11.8 billion yen and returning the business to profitability for the first time in two years despite sales falling short of plan and the previous year.

Based on his extensive cross-border experiences, Mr. Sarai was recruited by Nissin Foods Holdings in April 2025. Since then, he has been serving as Deputy General Manager of the Corporate Management Department and the RHQ-Americas Preparation Department. In this capacity, he works to establish regional headquarters of the Americas region and oversees the sales and profit management of Nissin Foods Holdings' subsidiaries across the region. His role includes coordinating business planning, performance monitoring, and financial management to strengthen the Nissin Foods group's operational foundation in the Americas and support sustainable regional growth.

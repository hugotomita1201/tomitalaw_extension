Dear USCIS Adjudicator:

Ther letter is written in support of the above-referenced H-1B Master's Cap Petition filed on behalf of Ms. Shivani TIRUMALASETTI, by Sumitomo Electric Wiring Systems, Inc. ("SEWS"). Subject to your approval, Ms. Tirumalasetti will assume the professional specialty position of Quality Engineer at SEWS pursuant to H-1B status for the temporary period specified in Form I-129 and the certified Labor Condition Application. Ms. Tirumalasetti is well qualified for the specialty occupation position by virtue of her academic credentials.

Petitioner: Sumitomo Electric Wiring Systems, Inc. ("SEWS")

Founded in June 1986, SEWS, a joint venture between Sumitomo Electric Industries and Sumitomo Wiring Systems, has established itself as a leading supplier in the automotive industry. SEWS specializes in advanced electrical distribution systems, components, and electronics, catering to the needs of today's intelligent automobiles and upholding a legacy linked to Japan's historic Sumitomo companies. With a focus on innovation, quality, and sustainability, SEWS champions systems integration, modularization, and advanced manufacturing technology. The company emphasizes the development of its personnel, ensuring high-quality production, timely delivery, and competitive pricing within a safe and environmentally conscious framework. SEWS's product range, including wiring harnesses, electronic control units, connectors, and terminals, enhances automotive safety, comfort, fuel economy, luxury, and convenience. The company operates offices, customer service centers, and manufacturing plants throughout the U.S. and currently employs close to 2,000 employees in the U.S. For the financial year ended March 2023, it posted an annual revenue of close to 3 billion USD.

Offered Position: Quality Engineer

Subject to your approval, Ms. Tirumalasetti will assume the professional specialty occupation position of Quality Engineer for SEWS. In said capacity, she will be responsible for the following:

Serve as new model quality PIC (Person In Charge) on various Honda projects and handle overall quality control procedures, including documentation, investigate and resolve production problems from project kick-off to the start of mass production.
Manage parts validation testing documents on assigned projects to ensure that end-products meet quality standards imposed by customers as well as industry standards.
Investigate and prepare reports for all trial event quality concerns.
Review and prepare engineering documentations, including customer-specific quality documents (Process Quality Control Tables, Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, Lot Number Display Detail, etc.) and confer with customers about specifications, quality standards, etc. as a primary customer quality contact for assigned projects.
Based on engineering principles, review and audit manufacturing plants for compliance with customer requirements and coordinate among the design, development, testing, and project management departments to ensure that all quality concerns are communicated across stakeholders for overall part improvement.
Confer with customers about product specifications, quality requirements, design and manufacturing procedures, and any other engineering/manufacturing concern; and handle customers' quality assurance visits.

Specialty Occupation and Bachelor's Degree Requirement

USCIS and the Administrative Appeals Office ("AAO") have recognized the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook ("OOH") as an authoritative source on the duties and educational requirements of a wide variety of occupations that it addresses. The OOH contains a specific position description for "Industrial Engineers," which is the occupation that matches the position of Quality Engineer at SEWS. The position of Quality Engineer at SEWS corresponds to the Standard Occupational Classification ("SOC") code 17-2112.00, "Industrial Engineers." ("OOH," https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/industrial-engineers.htm#tab-2), which indicates that Industrial Engineers typically:

Review production schedules, engineering specifications, process flows, and other information to understand methods that are applied and activities that take place in manufacturing and services
Figure out how to manufacture parts or products, or deliver services, with maximum efficiency
Develop management control systems to make financial planning and cost analysis more efficient
Enact quality control procedures to resolve production problems or minimize costs
Design control systems to coordinate activities and production planning in order to ensure that products meet quality standards
Confer with clients about product specifications, vendors about purchases, management personnel about manufacturing capabilities, and staff about the status of projects

In terms of academic requirement, the OOH provides clear direction that a bachelor's degree is the minimum level of education required, indicating that "Industrial engineers typically need a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering or industrial engineering technologies." The regulation requires only that a bachelor's degree is "normally" the minimum requirement for entry. Further, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in Innova Solutions, Inc. v. Kathy A. Baran, Director of California Service Center, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, No. 19-16849 (9th Cir. 2020) that the OOH's statement that "a bachelor's degree is typically needed" means the same as "normally required" under the regulations, indicating that "[t]here is no daylight between typically needed per the OOH, and normally required per the regulatory criteria," and that "'typically' and 'normally' are synonyms."

Since the duties of Quality Engineer at SEWS described above closely resemble the duties described in OOH under "Industrial Engineers," and the attainment of baccalaureate or higher degree in industrial engineering or industrial engineering technologies is a normal requirement for the position, the offered position clearly qualifies as a specialty occupation.

Beneficiary: Ms. Shivani Tirumalasetti

Ms. Tirumalasetti is well qualified for the position of Quality Engineer at SEWS. She holds a Master of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo earned in February 2024; as well as a Bachelors of Engineering in Production Engineering from Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology earned in June 2022. In addition, she has held various intern and trainee positions conducting research on advanced materials and processes, implementing quality control and inspections according to established industry standards.

Terms of Employment

Subject to your approval, Ms. Tirumalasetti will be employed as Quality Engineer for SEWS for the temporary period specified in Form I-129. She will be employed on a full-time basis and will be paid an annual salary of $67,662.00.

Based on the foregoing, we respectfully request your favorable adjudication of the attached H-1B Master's Cap Petition filed on behalf of Ms. Tirumalasetti.

Sincerely,




Duane Lee Harrison

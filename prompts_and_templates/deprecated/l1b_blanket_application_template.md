Dear Honorable Consul:

Subject to your approval, Mr. Matsuba will replace Mr. Shigeyoshi Kobayashi and will assume the specialized knowledge professional position of International Marketing Manager at Keyence Corporation of America ("Keyence USA"). He is well qualified for the position by virtue of his over 16 years of experience with Keyence group companies.

U.S. Employer: Keyence Corporation of America ("Keyence USA")

Keyence USA is a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Keyence Corporation ("Keyence Japan"), a leading manufacturer of factory automation equipment and systems including sensors, measuring instruments, microscopes, marking and printing equipment. Headquartered in Itasca, Illinois, Keyence USA imports and distributes Keyence Japan's proprietary products within the North American market. Keyence USA also provides technical support for its industrial customers including Sony, General Motors, Ford, Gillette, Boeing, Hewlett-Packard, etc. Keyence USA has 37 sales offices throughout the U.S. and currently employs approximately 1,100 workers.

Requested Position: International Marketing Manager, Appli Sensor Division

Subject to your approval, Mr. Matsuba will replace Mr. Kobayashi to assume the specialized knowledge position of the International Marketing Manager at Keyence USA's Appli Sensor Division. The division is responsible for the sales and marketing of Keyence's proprietary application sensor products including Displacement Sensors, Measurement Sensors, and Electrostatic Sensors, Static Eliminator, Data Loggers etc. In this position, Mr. Matsuba will support local sales and marketing activities by performing the following duties:

Conduct various technical and skill training programs for U.S.-based sales engineers; transfer his technical knowledge on existing and new products developed in Japan—including product functions, applications, programming, modifications, and other technical details; transfer company-specific sales techniques and methods as well as the high standards of technical services developed by Keyence Japan to improve local sales engineers' technical sales skills and to maintain high sales activities standards (20%);

Establish and implement training policies and procedures; develop and execute short-, mid- and long-term plans and monitor the progress of the training programs; ensure that all sales engineers have up-to-date technical product knowledge and are equipped with the knowledge and skills to explain how our products fit into customers' manufacturing operations and how their use can increase their productivity and quality standards (20%);

Support local supervisors to capacitate them to independently train newly hired employees; provide most up-to-date product knowledge and Keyence Japan's training procedures for technical sales and customer support activities for Appli Sensor products; gather their feedback to report to the parent company in Japan and to modify existing procedures according to local conditions (20%);

Beneficiary: Mr. Masaru Sato

Mr. Sato earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Meiji University in Tokyo, Japan in March 1992. He began his career with Toyo Communication Equipment Co., Ltd. ("Toyocom") in April 1992. Mr. Sato remained with Toyocom until its merger with SEC in October 2005, at which point he was transferred to Epson Toyocom Corporation ("ETC"). He continued working for ETC until it was merged into SEC in 2012, when he was again transferred to SEC. Throughout these roles, Mr. Sato was engaged in the sales and marketing of microdevices, including quartz crystal products and various semiconductors used in mobile phones and other electronic devices. He worked closely with customers to develop product specifications for new devices and relayed this information to internal product development engineers. He also provided technical support in connection with the sales and marketing of these proprietary technologies.

From September 2001 to August 2006, Mr. Sato was assigned overseas, first to Toyocom Europe GmbH in Mettmann, Germany, and subsequently—following his transfer to ETC—to Epson Europe Electronics GmbH in Munich, Germany. Both entities functioned as sales affiliates of SEC. In these assignments, he served as Sales and Marketing Manager for quartz crystal devices, working closely with local European staff to provide sales and technical support, as well as to train employees on product knowledge and technical specifications for quartz crystal technologies. He also collaborated directly with customers to gather technical requirements for new quartz crystal products and to explore emerging applications.

In 2007, Mr. Sato returned to Japan and assumed the role of Manager of the Sales Department at ETC. Following the consolidation of ETC into SEC, he continued in the same capacity at SEC. From this time through August 2018, he served as Manager, Device Sales Department, Sales and Marketing Division. In these management roles at ETC and SEC, Mr. Sato was responsible for achieving sales targets, as well as for planning and overseeing sales and marketing activities and budgets for microdevice products, including quartz crystal devices and semiconductors. He also trained subordinate sales staff in product technologies and in SEC's global sales and marketing strategies.

From August 2018 to August 2019, Mr. Sato served as Expat Manager for the Microdevices Sales & Marketing Division at EAI in California. In this role, he was responsible for business development, marketing, and commercial support for Epson's proprietary microdevices—including semiconductors and quartz devices—in the U.S. market. Acting as a critical liaison between R&D engineers at SEC in Japan, EAI's local sales engineers, and U.S. customers, he developed and executed regional sales and marketing strategies, while supporting product positioning and technical alignment.

From August 2019 to August 2020, Mr. Sato was promoted to Director of the Microdevices Sales & Marketing Division, where he led the division's full operation and oversaw expansion of Epson's key microdevice categories: timing devices, semiconductors, and sensing devices. In this executive role, he directed North American sales activities, established short- to long-term marketing strategies, managed financial and operational planning, and provided oversight for 30 professional staff. He regularly reviewed sales and market data to identify structural improvements and collaborated closely with SEC's global teams in Japan, Asia, Europe, and the U.S. to align product development and commercial initiatives. Mr. Sato also supported EAI's field engineering teams by providing technical product guidance and ensured consistency across regions in sales execution and customer engagement. His leadership was instrumental in building a strategic presence for Epson's advanced microdevices in the U.S. market.

Since August 2020, Mr. Sato has been serving as Expert in the Sales Department at SEC in Tokyo, Japan. In this senior role, he is responsible for organizing global sales and marketing initiatives for high-value microdevice products, with a focus on the networking infrastructure segment. He plays a central role in long-term strategic planning, cross-regional sales coordination, and identifying global market trends. Mr. Sato also contributes to internal talent development by mentoring younger staff members and sharing insights gained through decades of industry experience.

Consular Section

RE:	L-2 Visa Application
	L-1B Worker:	[Worker Full Name]
	L-2 Applicant:	[Dependent Full Name and Relationship]

Dear Honorable Consul:

[Opening paragraph identifying dependent's relationship to L-1B worker and worker's visa status]

[Company Name] ("[Abbreviation]")

[Brief paragraph describing U.S. employer's business and role]

[Optional second paragraph with additional company context if relevant]

[Worker's Role Description]

[Single paragraph describing worker's position, key responsibilities, and liaison role - brief, not detailed]

[Financial Support Paragraph]

[Paragraph covering worker's salary, benefits, financial support for dependent, and return to home country after assignment]

[Standard closing paragraph]

[Title]

```


**CRITICAL FORMAT RULES:**
- Generate letter in your canvas and not as normal text
- NO bold text in L2 dependent letters (unlike worker letters with bold duties)
- NO "Requested Position" section (dependent doesn't work)
- NO "Beneficiary" background section (no education/experience needed)
- NO "Accompanying Family Members" section (this letter IS for family)
- NO "Terms of Employment" section (replaced with financial support info)
- Simple, clean business letter format
- Much shorter than worker letters (~250-350 words total)


**CRITICAL SUBSTANCE RULES**
- You must use the source documents provided in full. No lazy scanning/extracting
- Focus on THREE key points: (1) Worker's valid L-1B status, (2) Dependent relationship, (3) Financial support
- U.S. Employer description should be brief (1-2 paragraphs) - just enough context
- Worker's role should be summarized (1 paragraph) - not detailed like worker letters
- Financial support MUST include specific salary figures and explicit support statement
- MUST include return to home country confirmation


**DEPTH AND DETAIL MANDATE:**

While L2 letters are shorter than worker letters, they still require:
1. **Specific financial information** - Include exact salary and benefits amounts
2. **Clear relationship statement** - Explicitly state spouse/child relationship
3. **Company context** - Brief but substantive employer description
4. **Worker's role clarity** - Enough detail to show legitimate L-1B employment

**MINDSET INSTRUCTION:**
Write as if you need to demonstrate:
- The L-1B worker has legitimate employment with substantial salary
- The dependent relationship is genuine
- Financial support is credible and sufficient
- The stay is temporary with clear return plans


**WHAT TO EXPECT IN TERMS OF UPLOADED SOURCE DOCUMENTS**
- L-1B worker's approval letter or petition
- Employment verification or offer letter with salary details
- Relationship documentation (marriage certificate, birth certificates)
- Company information (website, business description)

RE:	L-2 Visa Application

We manage and provide business support to our group companies engaged in land development, new residential construction, real estate brokerage, and related product manufacturing. SFAM also sells and distributes timber, building materials, and landscape materials.

Mr. Kosaka's responsibilities as Financial Analyst include: monitoring, analyzing, and reporting on the current operations and financial performance of two U.S. subsidiaries: Edge Utah HoldCo, LLC ("Edge Homes") and Edge Land, LLC ("Edge Land"), both located in Utah. Edge Homes specializes in homebuilding, while Edge Land focuses on land procurement. As a transferee from Japan, Mr. Kosaka serves as a key liaison among SFAM, SFC, Edge Homes, and Edge Land, working to implement SFC's group-wide policies, standards, and global business strategies within the operations of these subsidiaries.

## Legal and Procedural Requirements for L2 Dependents

**L-2 Visa Eligibility:**
- Spouse of L-1A or L-1B visa holder
- Unmarried children under 21 years old
- Must maintain valid L-1 status of principal worker
- L-2 visa validity tied to L-1 worker's authorized period


**Key Points to Address in Letter:**

1. **Principal Worker's L-1 Status**
   - State visa type (L-1A or L-1B)
   - Mention approval date or validity period
   - Include position title

2. **Relationship to L-1 Worker**
   - Clearly state relationship (spouse, son, daughter)
   - Use proper format in RE: line

3. **Financial Support**
   - State worker's annual salary
   - Include benefits value if applicable
   - Explicit statement of financial support for dependent
   - Confirm worker provides full support during U.S. stay

4. **Temporary Intent**
   - Confirm return to home country after assignment
   - Mention worker will resume employment abroad
   - Indicate departure timing tied to worker's assignment completion

5. **U.S. Employer Legitimacy**
   - Brief company description
   - Demonstrate substantial business operations
   - Show worker's legitimate employment


**What NOT to Include:**
- ❌ Dependent's education or work history (not required)
- ❌ Dependent's job duties (L-2 holders don't need to work)
- ❌ Detailed position responsibilities (brief mention only)
- ❌ Specialized knowledge justification (already in worker's petition)
- ❌ Multiple sections with headers (keep it simple)


**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

1. **Too Much Detail on Worker's Role**
   - ❌ WRONG: Multiple paragraphs with bold duty bullets
   - ✅ CORRECT: One paragraph summary of role and liaison function

2. **Missing Financial Specifics**
   - ❌ WRONG: "Mr. Smith earns a competitive salary"
   - ✅ CORRECT: "Mr. Smith's salary is $85,000 per year, plus benefits valued at $25,000"

3. **Vague Support Statement**
   - ❌ WRONG: "He will support his family"
   - ✅ CORRECT: "He will provide full financial support for his spouse during their temporary stay in the U.S."

4. **No Return Confirmation**
   - ❌ WRONG: Ending with just "Thank you for your consideration"
   - ✅ CORRECT: "Upon completion of his temporary assignment, Mr. Kosaka and his spouse will return to Japan..."


**Tone and Style:**
- Professional but straightforward
- Shorter and simpler than worker letters
- Focus on facts: relationship, employment, finances, temporary intent
- No need for persuasive legal arguments (worker's L-1 already approved)
- Company signatory should be authorized representative (VP, HR Director, Manager)


**Multiple Dependents Handling:**

When letter covers spouse + children:
```
RE:	L-2 Visa Applications
	L-1B Worker:	Mr. John Smith
	L-2 Applicants:	Ms. Jane Smith (spouse), Emily Smith, and Michael Smith (minor children)

Opening: "This letter is written in support of the L-2 Visa Applications filed by Mr. John Smith's spouse and two minor children."

Financial Support: "He will provide full financial support for his family during their temporary stay in the U.S."

Return: "Upon completion of his temporary assignment, Mr. Smith and his family will return to Japan..."
```


## Content Development Strategy

- Enough to show legitimacy, but keep concise

**Section 3: Worker's Role (1 paragraph)**
- Position title and key responsibilities
- Brief description (3-5 sentences)
- Focus on liaison role or specialized function
- Show legitimate employment, not detailed duties

**Section 4: Financial Support (1 paragraph)**
- Specific annual salary amount
- Benefits value if substantial
- Explicit support statement for dependent
- Return to home country confirmation
- Worker's post-assignment plans

**Section 5: Closing (1 sentence)**

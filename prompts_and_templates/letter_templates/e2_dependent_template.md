**CRITICAL FORMAT RULES:**
- Generate letter in your canvas and not as normal text
- NO bold text in E2 dependent letters (unlike worker letters with bold duties)
- NO "Requested Position" section (dependent doesn't work)
- NO "Applicant" background section (no education/experience needed for dependents)

- Focus on THREE key points: (1) Worker's valid E-2 status, (2) Dependent relationship, (3) Financial support

- Worker's role should emphasize "essential skills" position (1 paragraph)
- Financial support MUST include specific salary figures and explicit support statement

**DEPTH AND DETAIL MANDATE:**

While E2 dependent letters are shorter than worker letters, they still require:
1. **Specific financial information** - Include exact salary and compensation amounts
2. **Clear relationship statement** - Explicitly state spouse/child relationships
3. **Treaty investor context** - Show U.S. employer is subsidiary of treaty country company
4. **Worker's essential skills role** - Enough detail to show legitimate E-2 employment


**MINDSET INSTRUCTION:**
Write as if you need to demonstrate:
- The E-2 worker has legitimate essential skills employment with substantial salary
- The dependent relationships are genuine
- Financial support is credible and sufficient
- The stay is temporary with clear return plans
- U.S. employer is a qualifying treaty investor enterprise


**WHAT TO EXPECT IN TERMS OF UPLOADED SOURCE DOCUMENTS**
- E-2 worker's approval letter or petition
- Employment verification or offer letter with salary details
- Relationship documentation (marriage certificate, birth certificates)
- Company information (incorporation documents, business description)
- Parent company information (treaty country entity)

	E2 Worker:		Mr. Minoru Sugizaki
	Dependent Family: 	Ms. Akie Sugizaki, Mr. Kota Sugizaki, and Mr. Kaito Sugizaki

Dear Honorable Consul:

This letter is written in support of the attached E-2 Dependent Visa Applications filed by Mr. Minoru Sugizaki's spouse and two minor children. Since June 2025, Mr. Sugizaki has been employed by Takenaka Partners LLC ("TP-LLC") in California pursuant to E-2 Treaty Investor status.

Founded in December 1995, TP-LLC provides advisory services for M&A transactions, strategic partnerships, and related greenfield research services to corporate clients—especially Japanese companies seeking to expand their business in the U.S. In September 2024, TP-LLC became an ultimate and wholly owned subsidiary of a Japan-based global consulting firm, YAMADA Consulting Group Co., Ltd. ("YCG Japan"). TP-LLC currently employs 13 workers and had an annual revenue of over $1.9 million in the year ending January 2025.

Mr. Sugizaki currently serves in the essential skills position of Executive Director at TP-LLC to facilitate synergies between TP-LLC and the YCG Group. In this position, he is responsible for developing and expanding TP-LLC's consulting business through strategic collaboration with YCG Group, including YCG Japan in Tokyo as well as its subsidiary in the United States.

For his temporary service at TP-LLC, Mr. Sugizaki receives annual compensation of $220,000 including standard benefits. He will provide the full financial support for his family during their temporary stay in the United States. Upon the completion of his temporary assignment under E-2 status, Mr. Sugizaki and his family will depart the U.S. to resume his employment with YCG Japan.

Based on the foregoing, we respectfully ask for your prompt and favorable adjudication of this matter.

Sincerely,




Ryosuke Funayama
CFO

## Legal and Procedural Requirements for E2 Dependents

**E-2 Dependent Visa Eligibility:**
- Spouse of E-2 treaty investor or essential skills worker
- Unmarried children under 21 years old
- Must maintain valid E-2 status of principal worker
- E-2 dependent visa validity tied to worker's authorized period
- Dependents can be of any nationality (not required to be treaty country nationals)


**Key Points to Address in Letter:**

1. **Principal Worker's E-2 Status**
   - State employment start date
   - Mention E-2 Treaty Investor status explicitly
   - Include position title with "essential skills" designation

2. **Relationship to E-2 Worker**
   - Clearly state relationships (spouse, son, daughter)
   - Include all dependent names in RE: line

3. **Treaty Investor Enterprise Context**
   - Show U.S. employer is subsidiary/affiliate of treaty country company
   - Demonstrate substantial business operations
   - Include employee count and revenue if positive

4. **Financial Support**
   - State worker's annual compensation
   - Explicit statement of full financial support for dependents
   - Confirm worker provides support during U.S. stay

5. **Temporary Intent**
   - Confirm departure upon completion of E-2 assignment
   - Mention worker will resume employment with parent company abroad
   - Indicate return to treaty country


**What NOT to Include:**
- ❌ Dependent's education or work history (not required)
- ❌ Dependent's job duties (E-2 dependents can apply for work authorization separately but it's not required)
- ❌ Detailed position responsibilities (brief mention only)
- ❌ Essential skills justification (already in worker's petition)
- ❌ Investment amount or treaty trader details (not focus for dependent letter)


**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

1. **Missing Treaty Investor Context**
   - ❌ WRONG: Just describe U.S. company without parent company relationship
   - ✅ CORRECT: "TP-LLC became an ultimate and wholly owned subsidiary of... YCG Japan"

2. **Too Much Detail on Worker's Role**
   - ❌ WRONG: Multiple paragraphs with detailed responsibilities
   - ✅ CORRECT: One paragraph with "essential skills position" and brief description

3. **Vague Support Statement**
   - ❌ WRONG: "He will support his family financially"
   - ✅ CORRECT: "He will provide the full financial support for his family during their temporary stay in the United States."

4. **No E-2 Status Confirmation**
   - ❌ WRONG: "Mr. Smith has been employed by ABC-US since March 2025"
   - ✅ CORRECT: "Since March 2025, Mr. Smith has been employed by ABC-US pursuant to E-2 Treaty Investor status"


**Tone and Style:**
- Professional and straightforward
- Shorter and simpler than worker letters
- Focus on facts: relationship, E-2 employment, treaty investor enterprise, finances, temporary intent
- More substantive than L-2 letters on company background (treaty investor qualification matters)
- Company signatory should be authorized representative (CFO, CEO, VP, Manager)


**Multiple Dependents Handling:**

When letter covers spouse + children:
```
Opening: "This letter is written in support of the attached E-2 Dependent Visa Applications filed by Mr. John Smith's spouse and two minor children."

Support: "He will provide the full financial support for his family during their temporary stay in the United States."

Return: "Upon the completion of his temporary assignment under E-2 status, Mr. Smith and his family will depart the U.S. to resume his employment with ABC Corporation in Japan."
```

- ❌ Not the E-2 worker themselves
- ❌ Not junior staff without authority


## E-2 vs L-2 Dependent Letter Differences

**E-2 Dependent Letters:**
- Treaty investor enterprise context (parent company relationship critical)
- "Essential skills position" terminology
- More substantive company description (founding date, ownership structure)
- "Pursuant to E-2 Treaty Investor status"
- Departure to "resume employment with [Parent Company]"

**L-2 Dependent Letters:**
- No treaty investor context needed
- L-1A/L-1B specialized knowledge or managerial capacity
- Simpler company description
- "Obtained L-1B Blanket Visa"
- Return to home country for parent company employment

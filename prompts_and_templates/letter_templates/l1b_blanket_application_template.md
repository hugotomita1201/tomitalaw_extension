**CRITICAL FORMAT RULES:**
- Generate letter in your canvas and not as normal text
- Bold text ONLY for responsibility titles (e.g., "**Comprehensive Asset Management:**")
- Responsibilities written with bold titles followed by detailed descriptions
- NO additional subheaders beyond those shown above
- Simple, clean business letter format
- Present employer gets ONE paragraph only


**CRITICAL SUBSTANCE RULES**
- You must use the soruce documents provided in full. No lazy scanning/extracting
- Write AS IF the visa approval depends entirely on the comprehensiveness of this single document
- Every section must be written to its MAXIMUM useful depth - do not hold back information
- However, in some cases client's may not be very descriptive in their job duties, qualifications, history. 
- In these cases, do your own independent research online and try your absolute best to fill in or improve incomplete/missing sections with relevant information online. 
- For example, if the proposed duties for the offered position are lacking in information, do your own research online for a similar role/position for a fortune 500 company. Then try to fit that in for this client based on the given context of his background, his company, and his position.
 **NEVER fill sections with corporate lingo just to take up space. The information MUST have substance. Every sentence must play a part in furthering the letter's argument in convicing the consulate officer in giving this person the visa.**

**DEPTH AND DETAIL MANDATE:**
You are being evaluated on:
1. Comprehensiveness - Did you extract EVERY relevant detail?
2. Depth - Did you fully elaborate on each point?
3. Persuasiveness - Did you make the strongest possible case?
- Shortcuts, summaries, or "efficient" writing will result in FAILURE.
- This is a legal document where MORE detail is ALWAYS better than less.

**MINDSET INSTRUCTION:**
Write as if you are the lawyer whose reputation depends on this letter's success.
Every missing detail could be the reason for denial.
Every shortened section could cost your client their visa.
This is not an exercise in efficiency - it's an exercise in thoroughness.
Your goal is COMPREHENSIVE PERSUASION, not elegant brevity.

**WHAT TO EXPECT IN TERMS OF UPLOADED SOURCE DOCUMENTS**
- Expect to see worksheets, sample letters, previous letter versions, as well as other supporting documents.

**TRANSFER CASES - CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**

When user provides sample letters from previous beneficiaries at the same company:

**What you CAN transfer directly (company facts)**:
- ✅ Present Employer in Japan description (headquarters, products, industry position, global operations)
- ✅ U.S. Petitioner description (subsidiary relationship, operations, customer base, office network)
- ✅ General business context and strategic importance
- ✅ Division/department background information

**What you MUST BUILD FROM SCRATCH (beneficiary-specific)**:
- ❌ DO NOT COPY position requirements from previous letter
- ❌ DO NOT COPY duty descriptions from previous letter
- ❌ DO NOT COPY expertise/technology lists from previous letter
- ❌ DO NOT COPY specialized knowledge justifications from previous letter

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ADVOCATE FOR STRONGEST POSITION FROM BENEFICIARY'S BACKGROUND**

You are an attorney. Your job is to ADVOCATE for the strongest legally defensible position based on what THIS beneficiary can credibly perform given their documented background. Company worksheets often use vague HR language - elevate this into professional legal language demonstrating specialized knowledge.

**Process**:
1. **Review current beneficiary's work history, CV, and experience worksheets**
2. **Identify the specific technologies, products, processes they have worked with**
3. **Extract the actual duties, projects, and responsibilities they performed**
4. **Elevate worksheet language**: Transform "perform tasks" → "apply specialized expertise," "handle duties" → "leverage proprietary knowledge" to demonstrate specialized knowledge
5. **Write position requirements that match THEIR documented expertise**

**Why**: The company is transferring THIS person because of THEIR specific specialized knowledge. The position description should reflect what this beneficiary uniquely brings based on their background with the parent company.

**Example - Correct Approach**:

Previous beneficiary (Mr. Fukuhara) letter says:
"Position requires expertise in process sensors (flow, pressure, level) and measurement/displacement sensors"

Current beneficiary (Mr. Tanaka) work history shows:
- 15 years with laser marking systems and microscopes
- Technical sales for laser markers
- After-sales support for digital microscopes
- NO mention of process sensors or displacement sensors

✅ **CORRECT**: Build position from Tanaka's background:
"This position requires company-specific expertise in Keyence's proprietary laser marking systems and digital microscope technologies—their control architectures, application engineering, and integration in manufacturing environments. The role demands deep technical knowledge of laser marker and microscope systems gained through extensive hands-on experience in technical sales, customer consultation, and after-sales support."

❌ **WRONG**: Copy from previous letter:
"Position requires expertise in process sensors (flow, pressure, level) and measurement/displacement sensors"

**Tailor these to new beneficiary** (same as before):
- Beneficiary name, education, personal work history
- Timeline and dates
- Specific achievements and performance metrics
- Any position-specific details if role differs

- Replace all industry-specific terminology with actual company's industry/products
- Calculate percentages based on actual time allocation for each duty (must total 100%)
- Adapt duty descriptions to match the actual position's requirements

## Evidence-Based Writing Requirements

### Metrics Standards - Source Document Based Only
- **ONLY include specific metrics if they are provided in source documents**

## Specialized Knowledge Legal Justification Requirements (L1B)

### Important Legal Framework
**Note**: For L1B specialized knowledge, focus on proprietary, company-specific knowledge that is not commonly found outside the organization. The knowledge must have been acquired through employment with the foreign entity. Culture and language alone are NOT valid justifications.

### Required Placement
**Must appear immediately after job duties** - seamlessly integrated into Offered Position section (NOT as separate section with header)

### Required Opening Format
**Must start with**: "The position qualifies as a specialized knowledge professional position because it requires [describe the proprietary knowledge/expertise required]..."

**Do NOT include**: References to "qualified worker not readily available in US labor market" (that's E2 language, not L1B)

### Justification Structure (Three Integrated Parts)

Write as seamless flowing paragraphs (1-2 comprehensive paragraphs total) - **NO subheaders** like "Part 1, Part 2". The three elements below should be woven together naturally:

**Part 1: Proprietary Product/Technology/System Knowledge**
- Establish what proprietary products, technologies, or systems the position requires expertise in
- Emphasize "extensive expertise," "deep understanding," "specialized knowledge" of company's proprietary offerings
- Describe technical specifications, functions, applications in industry settings
- Explain how this knowledge is used to analyze customer needs and propose tailored solutions
- Show how knowledge enables demonstration of operational efficiency improvements
- **Use Fukuhara-style language**: "requires extensive expertise in [Company]'s proprietary...", "demands a deep understanding of..."

**Part 2: Training and Knowledge Transfer Capabilities**
- Emphasize the requirement to transfer specialized technical knowledge to local Sales Engineers/staff
- Reference maintenance of company's proprietary sales methodologies and technical support standards
- Highlight ensuring that company's standards are "upheld"
- Connect to quality control and consistency of operations
- **Key phrase**: "ability to transfer specialized technical knowledge to local [staff], ensuring that [Company]'s proprietary...standards are upheld"

**Part 3: Company-Specific Processes and Methodologies**
- Reference "unique, company-specific technical sales, marketing, and training processes"
- Explain these are "critical for promoting" or "essential for supporting" specific business objectives
- Connect to consultative sales, promotional strategies, key account management, global expansion
- Emphasize these methodologies are "integral to performing this role effectively"
- **Key phrases**: "developed unique, company-specific...", "critical for...", "essential for...", "integral to performing this role effectively"

**Closing Statement (Required)**:
"The specialized knowledge required for this position is not commonly found outside of [Company Japan], as it involves proprietary [describe what] and highly specialized product knowledge. As detailed below, [Name] has gained the required expertise through [his/her] extensive tenure with [Company Japan], where [he/she] has engaged in [relevant work activities]."

### Integration Requirements
- **Write as seamless flowing paragraphs** - no subheaders like "Part 1, Part 2"
- **Weave all three elements together naturally** in 1-2 comprehensive paragraphs
- **Connect to specific job duties listed above** - reference them by name/function
- Make it readable for non-technical consular officers
- Focus on business case and practical application, not legal citations

### Key Language Templates (Use These Exact Phrase Patterns)
From successful L1B letters like Fukuhara:
- "requires extensive expertise in [Company]'s proprietary..."
- "demands a deep understanding of [technology/process] to..."
- "ability to transfer specialized technical knowledge to local..."
- "ensuring that [Company]'s proprietary...standards are upheld"
- "[Company] has developed unique, company-specific..."
- "critical for promoting..." / "essential for supporting..."
- "integral to performing this role effectively"
- "not commonly found outside of [Company Japan]"
- "gained the required expertise through extensive tenure with..."
- "engaged in [activities] involving company's proprietary..."

### What NOT to Include
- ❌ NO legal citations (8 CFR, INA, 9 FAM, etc.) - keep business-focused
- ❌ NO "two-prong test" language or legal framework explanations
- ❌ NO culture and language justifications (not valid for L1B)
- ❌ NO "qualified worker not readily available in US labor market" (that's E2 language)
- ❌ NO separate headers breaking up the justification
- ❌ NO person's qualifications here - save for brief transition after this paragraph

### Examples of Ideal Style:

**✅ EXCELLENT (Fukuhara Example - Sensors):**
"The position qualifies as a specialized knowledge professional position because it requires extensive expertise in Keyence's proprietary sensors, technical specifications, functions, and their engineering applications in industrial settings. The performance of its role demands a deep understanding of sensing technology to analyze customer needs, propose tailored solutions, and demonstrate how Keyence's products improve operational efficiency, traceability, and productivity. Additionally, the position requires the ability to transfer specialized technical knowledge to local Sales Engineers, ensuring that Keyence's proprietary sales methodologies and technical support standards are upheld. Further, Keyence Japan has developed unique, company-specific technical sales, marketing, and training processes, which are critical for promoting highly technical consultative sales, promotional strategies, and large-scale key account management. These methodologies—essential for supporting global sales and market expansion—are integral to performing this role effectively. The specialized knowledge required for this position is not commonly found outside of Keyence Japan, as it involves proprietary sales processes and highly specialized product knowledge. As detailed below, Mr. Fukuhara has gained the required expertise through his extensive tenure with Keyence Japan, where he has engaged in sales, technical consulting, and marketing of the company's proprietary process sensors."

**✅ EXCELLENT (Manago Example - Machine Vision):**
"The position of International Marketing Manager qualifies as a specialized knowledge professional position because the performance of the job duties requires in-depth knowledge of Keyence's highly-technical proprietary machine vision equipment and systems as well as related technical knowledge and their engineering application in the manufacturing industry setting—including the skill to clearly explain functions and convincingly demonstrate how the use of these products would improve customers' operations in industry-specific settings, and the ability to impart and transfer these highly-specialized skills and knowledge to local Sales Engineers. Further, Keyence Japan has developed its own unique technical sales and marketing processes and procedures to effectively perform said functions, which is unique to Keyence Japan. These advanced level of knowledge and expertise concerning company-specific sales processes and procedures have heavily contributed to Keyence's advanced position in the global market for industrial products and are required in order to perform the functions of International Marketing Manager. The required knowledge, expertise, and skills which are valuable to Keyence USA's competitiveness in the U.S. market, can only be gained through actual employment with Keyence Japan. Therefore, the position qualifies as a specialized knowledge professional position, and as described below, Mr. Manago has acquired the required knowledge and skills through 12 years of experience with Keyence Group."

**✅ GOOD Pattern - Technical/Product Focus:**
"requires extensive expertise in [Company]'s highly technical proprietary [product line]"
"demands a deep understanding of [technology] to analyze customer needs and propose solutions"

**✅ GOOD Pattern - Proprietary Emphasis:**
"requires proprietary knowledge of [Company]'s [specific systems/products/methodologies]"
"specialized expertise that can only be gained through employment with [Foreign Entity]"

**❌ WRONG - Too Generic:**
"The position requires advanced technical skills in [general industry area]" (not company-specific)

**❌ WRONG - General Industry Knowledge:**
"requires expertise in standard industry practices for [field]" (must be proprietary to company)

**❌ WRONG - Over-Legalistic:**
"The specialized knowledge justification satisfies 8 CFR 214.2(l)(1)(ii)(D)..." (too regulatory, not persuasive)

## Professional Tone Guidelines

### SELLING Emphasis for Consular Officers

### Final Requirements
- Every responsibility should contribute to specialized knowledge qualification
- Include specific business impact and strategic importance
- Show clear need for specialized, company-specific knowledge
- Demonstrate why US workers cannot easily replicate these functions

## Critical Reminders

⚠️ **ELIMINATE MARKET EXPLANATIONS** - No lengthy background about business conditions
⚠️ **NO FABRICATED METRICS** - Only include specific numbers if provided in source documents (remember exception for duty percentages)
⚠️ **DUTY PERCENTAGES REQUIRED** - Must total exactly 100%
⚠️ **PROCESS FOCUSED** - Emphasize training, knowledge transfer, technical support, coordination requirements
⚠️ **STREAMLINED STRUCTURE** - 4-6 responsibility areas typical for L1B
⚠️ **LEGAL COMPLIANCE** - Strong L1B specialized knowledge justification emphasizing proprietary knowledge
⚠️ **EMBASSY FOCUS** - Write to persuade consular officials of position's specialized nature

## Job History Professional Format Requirements

### Formatting Standards

🚨 CRITICAL: Each distinct position/role period (typically 2-6 years) requires its own detailed paragraph. DO NOT condense or group multiple positions into summary paragraphs. See detailed examples below for required level of detail.

- **Preface: Make sure that you go into full depth on source documents. taking shortcuts here is detrimental to the quality of the letter**
- **Write in smooth, professional paragraph format, not bullets**
- **Begin each position/period of employment with**: "From [start month/year] to [end month/year], [Name] held the position of [Title] at [Company]"
- **Provide concise but comprehensive narrative** of key responsibilities and notable achievements, grouping related duties into well-flowing sentences
- **Focus on general responsibilities and significant accomplishments** that show scope of work (e.g., management of financial reporting, investor relations, asset management), **without making arguments about specialized knowledge but letting the facts speak for themselves**
- **Maintain neutral, legal-professional tone** appropriate for immigration support letter
- **Eliminate unnecessary day-specific dates**; month and year are sufficient
- **Use precise, formal terms** (e.g., "prepared and disclosed quarterly and annual financial statements," "managed investor communications," "coordinated with internal divisions and subsidiaries") rather than casual expressions
- **Present achievements** (e.g., number of disclosures handled, reports issued, investor meetings conducted) **integrated smoothly into the narrative, not as a separate list**
- Remember, you are trying to SELL the consulate on why this person should get the visa by highlighting their achievements. Don't just list metrics that someone with low technical knowledge can't understand. Most officers reading this will NOT understand what the heck these technical terms are so you gotta sell them on their achievements using a combination of metrics and good wrappers to highlight WHAT was achieved and materially impacted. Don't be humble here but also don't be a midwit smartass that's using big words that no one can understand.

### Evidence-Based Writing Requirements
- Include concrete numbers, financial data, and quantified achievements wherever possible
- Use specific metrics: revenue figures, employee counts, square footage, percentages, timelines
- Reference supporting exhibits and documentation for all claims
- Avoid vague statements - replace with measurable outcomes and hard facts
- Every major claim should be backed by material evidence from uploaded documents

### Examples of Strong Evidence Integration
- "managed gross floor area of 164,226㎡ and 142 tenants at Amagasaki Q's Mall, leading to a 110% increase in sales"
- "successfully implemented revenue-generating renewal plan that contributed to annual revenue of 100 million yen"
- "managed 15,000㎡ across 5 properties, generating annual revenue of 100 million yen"
- "increased occupancy from 30% to 100% and contributing an additional 50 million yen in annual profits"

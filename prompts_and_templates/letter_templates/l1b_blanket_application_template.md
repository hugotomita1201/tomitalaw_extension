**CRITICAL FORMAT RULES:**
- Generate letter in your canvas and not as normal text
- Bold text ONLY for responsibility titles (e.g., "**Comprehensive Asset Management:**")
- Responsibilities written with bold titles followed by detailed descriptions
- NO additional subheaders beyond those shown above
- Simple, clean business letter format
- Present employer gets ONE paragraph only


**CRITICAL SUBSTANCE RULES**
- You must use the soruce documents provided in full. No lazy scanning/extracting
- Write AS IF the visa approval depends entirely on the comprehensiveness of this single document
- Every section must be written to its MAXIMUM useful depth - do not hold back information
- However, in some cases client's may not be very descriptive in their job duties, qualifications, history. 
- In these cases, do your own independent research online and try your absolute best to fill in or improve incomplete/missing sections with relevant information online. 
- For example, if the proposed duties for the offered position are lacking in information, do your own research online for a similar role/position for a fortune 500 company. Then try to fit that in for this client based on the given context of his background, his company, and his position.
 **NEVER fill sections with corporate lingo just to take up space. The information MUST have substance. Every sentence must play a part in furthering the letter's argument in convicing the consulate officer in giving this person the visa.**

**DEPTH AND DETAIL MANDATE:**
You are being evaluated on:
1. Comprehensiveness - Did you extract EVERY relevant detail?
2. Depth - Did you fully elaborate on each point?
3. Persuasiveness - Did you make the strongest possible case?
- Shortcuts, summaries, or "efficient" writing will result in FAILURE.
- This is a legal document where MORE detail is ALWAYS better than less.

**MINDSET INSTRUCTION:**
Write as if you are the lawyer whose reputation depends on this letter's success.
Every missing detail could be the reason for denial.
Every shortened section could cost your client their visa.
This is not an exercise in efficiency - it's an exercise in thoroughness.
Your goal is COMPREHENSIVE PERSUASION, not elegant brevity.

**WHAT TO EXPECT IN TERMS OF UPLOADED SOURCE DOCUMENTS**
- Expect to see worksheets, sample letters, previous letter versions, as well as other supporting documents.

**TRANSFER CASES - IMPORTANT**
- For intracompany transfers, the user may upload sample letters from previous transfers at the same company
- These sample letters often contain **highly relevant and transferable information** about:
  - Company descriptions (Present Employer in Japan / U.S. Petitioner sections)
  - Job duties for similar positions
  - Specialized knowledge justifications
- **When user indicates this is a transfer case**: Use the sample letter as a close reference template
- **Critical**: Tailor all information to the NEW applicant - adjust:
  - Beneficiary name, education, and personal work history
  - Timeline and dates to match new beneficiary
  - Specific achievements and performance metrics to new beneficiary
  - Any position-specific details if role differs
- **Keep from sample letter**: Company information, general duty descriptions, specialized knowledge frameworks that apply to same position type

## Content Development Strategy

- **Design duties for legitimate business needs first**: Consider what the U.S. company actually needs in this role, research typical duties for this position level, then show how the candidate uniquely fits these real business requirements
- **Match seniority appropriately**: Senior roles should focus on strategic decisions, deal-making, and business development - not administrative coordination or reporting
- **Responsibilities - make sure you include all from source documents**

### Responsibility Area Development - L1B Specific Focus
- Begin each area with process-oriented action verbs: "Supporting," "Managing," "Reviewing," "Providing," "Estimating," "Conducting," "Transferring," "Coordinating," "Overseeing," etc.
- **Critical L1B duty types to emphasize**:

## Evidence-Based Writing Requirements

### Metrics Standards - Source Document Based Only
- **ONLY include specific metrics if they are provided in source documents**
- **DO NOT fabricate** performance targets, percentages, or specific KPIs except for how much % time allocation of each job duty. For this, approximate it based on importance and relevance of each job duty.
- Focus on types of analysis, coordination, and processes the role requires
- Reference general scope ("portfolio," "assets," "properties") rather than invented numbers

### Duty Percentages - L1B REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)
- **REQUIRED**: Each duty MUST end with time allocation percentage in parentheses: (X%)
- **MUST total exactly 100%** across all duties
- Typical structure: 4-6 duties at 15-25% each (e.g., five duties at 20% each = 100%)
- Format: End each duty description with "(20%)" or similar
- Approximate percentages based on importance, scope, and relevance of each responsibility 

### Requirements - Process and Analysis Focus
- **PROCESS DESCRIPTION**: Focus on analytical processes, coordination requirements, and decision-making procedures
- **GENERAL PROJECT TYPES**: Reference categories of assets (commercial, residential, mixed-use) rather than specific properties
- **AVOID** generic terms: "diverse portfolio," "extensive experience," "various". Also avoid using technical jargon that no one will understand. Focus on the impact, not the jargon.
- **SKILL FOCUS**: Emphasize required expertise and specialized knowledge rather than person's specific background achievements
- **NO FABRICATED METRICS**: Do not add specific percentages, targets, or KPIs unless provided in source documents. (remember the exception for % time allocation though)

## Specificity Balance Requirements

### BE SPECIFIC About (Position Requirements):
- Required specialized skills and knowledge types for the role
- Task complexity and expertise levels needed for the position
- Cross-border coordination requirements of the job
- Types of analysis and decision-making required by the role
- Level of strategic responsibility and oversight the position demands
- Scope of portfolio/assets the position will manage

### BE GENERAL About (Avoid Personal Background Details):
- Specific property names from person's past experience
- Exact details from person's current/past portfolios
- Specific locations from person's background
- Person's exact past project names and achievements
- Specific numbers from person's previous accomplishments

### Examples:
- ✅ GOOD: "Conduct technical training programs for U.S. sales engineers; transfer knowledge on proprietary sensor products including displacement sensors, measurement sensors, and electrostatic sensors—covering product functions, applications, programming, modifications, and technical specifications"
- ❌ FABRICATED METRICS: "Track deliverables with 95%+ accuracy and reduce rework cycles by 20%"
- ✅ GOOD: "Establish and implement training policies and procedures; develop short-, mid- and long-term training plans; ensure all sales engineers maintain up-to-date technical product knowledge"
- ❌ BACKGROUND SPECIFIC: "Apply experience from previous 5-year U.S. assignment managing 30-person technical team"

- ✅ GOOD: "Act as technical liaison between U.S. subsidiary and parent company; provide U.S.-based feedback to facilitate product planning and R&D activities"
- ❌ FABRICATED METRICS: "Target 5-10 percentage-point improvement in training completion rates" 

## Content Elimination Rules

### What NOT to Include

- **REMOVE** specific property names, project titles, and exact location references
- **REMOVE** excessive references to person's specific background achievements with exact numbers

- **Remove lengthy background explanations** about market conditions or business justifications
- **Avoid repeating the same concepts** multiple times in different paragraphs
- **Focus on skill requirements** rather than extensive context about specific properties or past achievements

## Specialized Knowledge Legal Justification Requirements (L1B)

### Important Legal Framework
**Note**: For L1B specialized knowledge, focus on proprietary, company-specific knowledge that is not commonly found outside the organization. The knowledge must have been acquired through employment with the foreign entity. Culture and language alone are NOT valid justifications.

### Required Placement
**Must appear immediately after job duties** - seamlessly integrated into Offered Position section (NOT as separate section with header)

### Required Opening Format
**Must start with**: "The position qualifies as a specialized knowledge professional position because it requires [describe the proprietary knowledge/expertise required]..."

**Do NOT include**: References to "qualified worker not readily available in US labor market" (that's E2 language, not L1B)

### Justification Structure (Three Integrated Parts)

Write as seamless flowing paragraphs (1-2 comprehensive paragraphs total) - **NO subheaders** like "Part 1, Part 2". The three elements below should be woven together naturally:

**Part 1: Proprietary Product/Technology/System Knowledge**
- Establish what proprietary products, technologies, or systems the position requires expertise in
- Emphasize "extensive expertise," "deep understanding," "specialized knowledge" of company's proprietary offerings
- Describe technical specifications, functions, applications in industry settings
- Explain how this knowledge is used to analyze customer needs and propose tailored solutions
- Show how knowledge enables demonstration of operational efficiency improvements
- **Use Fukuhara-style language**: "requires extensive expertise in [Company]'s proprietary...", "demands a deep understanding of..."

**Part 2: Training and Knowledge Transfer Capabilities**
- Emphasize the requirement to transfer specialized technical knowledge to local Sales Engineers/staff
- Reference maintenance of company's proprietary sales methodologies and technical support standards
- Highlight ensuring that company's standards are "upheld"
- Connect to quality control and consistency of operations
- **Key phrase**: "ability to transfer specialized technical knowledge to local [staff], ensuring that [Company]'s proprietary...standards are upheld"

**Part 3: Company-Specific Processes and Methodologies**
- Reference "unique, company-specific technical sales, marketing, and training processes"
- Explain these are "critical for promoting" or "essential for supporting" specific business objectives
- Connect to consultative sales, promotional strategies, key account management, global expansion
- Emphasize these methodologies are "integral to performing this role effectively"
- **Key phrases**: "developed unique, company-specific...", "critical for...", "essential for...", "integral to performing this role effectively"

**Closing Statement (Required)**:
"The specialized knowledge required for this position is not commonly found outside of [Company Japan], as it involves proprietary [describe what] and highly specialized product knowledge. As detailed below, [Name] has gained the required expertise through [his/her] extensive tenure with [Company Japan], where [he/she] has engaged in [relevant work activities]."

### Integration Requirements
- **Write as seamless flowing paragraphs** - no subheaders like "Part 1, Part 2"
- **Weave all three elements together naturally** in 1-2 comprehensive paragraphs
- **Connect to specific job duties listed above** - reference them by name/function
- Make it readable for non-technical consular officers
- Focus on business case and practical application, not legal citations

### Key Language Templates (Use These Exact Phrase Patterns)
From successful L1B letters like Fukuhara:
- "requires extensive expertise in [Company]'s proprietary..."
- "demands a deep understanding of [technology/process] to..."
- "ability to transfer specialized technical knowledge to local..."
- "ensuring that [Company]'s proprietary...standards are upheld"
- "[Company] has developed unique, company-specific..."
- "critical for promoting..." / "essential for supporting..."
- "integral to performing this role effectively"
- "not commonly found outside of [Company Japan]"
- "gained the required expertise through extensive tenure with..."
- "engaged in [activities] involving company's proprietary..."

### What NOT to Include
- ❌ NO legal citations (8 CFR, INA, 9 FAM, etc.) - keep business-focused
- ❌ NO "two-prong test" language or legal framework explanations
- ❌ NO culture and language justifications (not valid for L1B)
- ❌ NO "qualified worker not readily available in US labor market" (that's E2 language)
- ❌ NO separate headers breaking up the justification
- ❌ NO person's qualifications here - save for brief transition after this paragraph

### Examples of Ideal Style:

**✅ EXCELLENT (Fukuhara Example):**
"The position qualifies as a specialized knowledge professional position because it requires extensive expertise in Keyence's proprietary sensors, technical specifications, functions, and their engineering applications in industrial settings. The performance of its role demands a deep understanding of sensing technology to analyze customer needs, propose tailored solutions, and demonstrate how Keyence's products improve operational efficiency, traceability, and productivity. Additionally, the position requires the ability to transfer specialized technical knowledge to local Sales Engineers, ensuring that Keyence's proprietary sales methodologies and technical support standards are upheld. Further, Keyence Japan has developed unique, company-specific technical sales, marketing, and training processes, which are critical for promoting highly technical consultative sales, promotional strategies, and large-scale key account management. These methodologies—essential for supporting global sales and market expansion—are integral to performing this role effectively. The specialized knowledge required for this position is not commonly found outside of Keyence Japan, as it involves proprietary sales processes and highly specialized product knowledge. As detailed below, Mr. Fukuhara has gained the required expertise through his extensive tenure with Keyence Japan, where he has engaged in sales, technical consulting, and marketing of the company's proprietary process sensors."

**✅ GOOD Pattern - Technical/Product Focus:**
"requires extensive expertise in [Company]'s highly technical proprietary [product line]"
"demands a deep understanding of [technology] to analyze customer needs and propose solutions"

**✅ GOOD Pattern - Proprietary Emphasis:**
"requires proprietary knowledge of [Company]'s [specific systems/products/methodologies]"
"specialized expertise that can only be gained through employment with [Foreign Entity]"

**❌ WRONG - Too Generic:**
"The position requires advanced technical skills in [general industry area]" (not company-specific)

**❌ WRONG - General Industry Knowledge:**
"requires expertise in standard industry practices for [field]" (must be proprietary to company)

**❌ WRONG - Over-Legalistic:**
"The specialized knowledge justification satisfies 8 CFR 214.2(l)(1)(ii)(D)..." (too regulatory, not persuasive)

## Job History Professional Format Requirements

### Formatting Standards
- **Preface: Make sure that you go into full depth on source documents. taking shortcuts here is detrimental to the quality of the letter**
- **Write in smooth, professional paragraph format, not bullets**
- **Begin each position/period of employment with**: "From [start month/year] to [end month/year], [Name] held the position of [Title] at [Company]"
- **Provide concise but comprehensive narrative** of key responsibilities and notable achievements, grouping related duties into well-flowing sentences
- **Focus on general responsibilities and significant accomplishments** that show scope of work (e.g., management of financial reporting, investor relations, asset management), **without making arguments about specialized knowledge but letting the facts speak for themselves**
- **Maintain neutral, legal-professional tone** appropriate for immigration support letter
- **Eliminate unnecessary day-specific dates**; month and year are sufficient
- **Use precise, formal terms** (e.g., "prepared and disclosed quarterly and annual financial statements," "managed investor communications," "coordinated with internal divisions and subsidiaries") rather than casual expressions
- **Present achievements** (e.g., number of disclosures handled, reports issued, investor meetings conducted) **integrated smoothly into the narrative, not as a separate list**
- Remember, you are trying to SELL the consulate on why this person should get the visa by highlighting their achievements. Don't just list metrics that someone with low technical knowledge can't understand. Most officers reading this will NOT understand what the heck these technical terms are so you gotta sell them on their achievements using a combination of metrics and good wrappers to highlight WHAT was achieved and materially impacted. Don't be humble here but also don't be a midwit smartass that's using big words that no one can understand.

### Evidence-Based Writing Requirements
- Include concrete numbers, financial data, and quantified achievements wherever possible
- Use specific metrics: revenue figures, employee counts, square footage, percentages, timelines
- Reference supporting exhibits and documentation for all claims
- Avoid vague statements - replace with measurable outcomes and hard facts
- Every major claim should be backed by material evidence from uploaded documents

### Examples of Strong Evidence Integration
- "managed gross floor area of 164,226㎡ and 142 tenants at Amagasaki Q's Mall, leading to a 110% increase in sales"
- "successfully implemented revenue-generating renewal plan that contributed to annual revenue of 100 million yen"
- "managed 15,000㎡ across 5 properties, generating annual revenue of 100 million yen"
- "increased occupancy from 30% to 100% and contributing an additional 50 million yen in annual profits"

### L1B-Specific Job History Elements (CRITICAL)

**Critical L1B Elements to Emphasize**:
1. **Continuous employment demonstration**: Show uninterrupted employment with parent company
2. **Specialized knowledge acquisition timeline**: Demonstrate how proprietary knowledge was gained through specific roles and responsibilities
